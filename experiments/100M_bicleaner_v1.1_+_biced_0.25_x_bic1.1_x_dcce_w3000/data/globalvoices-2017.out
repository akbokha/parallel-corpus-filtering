although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free of Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very con@@ genial love letter about his size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won during the Republi@@ can Ele@@ ctions was the highest number ever reached by the nom@@ inations nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which absor@@ bs people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tru@@ mp has also agreed not to agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who was struggling with the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp was making his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand people acting and thinking in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise up a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Ü ) : &quot; as much as the Wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; white with white in allu@@ sions to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like whi@@ pl@@ ash injuries ) , as the big Van Jones suggests , has killed exactly what America has done so spectac@@ ul@@ arly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world .
but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp a huge part of America &apos;s white American promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried out , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is this not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is Tru@@ mp &apos;s land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love for music through garbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community have in common in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u ?
the fact that the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah , where the recycl@@ ers began to transform parts of the waste into instruments under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion that were all produced from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article published in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced out of apost@@ asy .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of garbage each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill @-@ fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
in West Africa at that time it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in li@@ beri@@ as before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and slightly inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to hire one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which then expelled the prime ministers from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand by each other where it is about illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , tra@@ ck@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . it is also possible to discover suspected driving routes - such as those indic@@ ative that a ship will load his captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can , on the basis of this information , refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay punishment , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD lost in lost turnover , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which is attracting the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ anta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and harness the weaknesses of a non @-@ un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t attack my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system which aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing companies use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal operating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , president of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the location of each tracking vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meeting with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year due to illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; states Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state of Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the exercise of office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by assembling on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an Region of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the north @-@ eastern province of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the re@@ election of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the Government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to depri@@ ve the country of its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , should continue to be blocking the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ ally nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images are pil@@ ed up which tell about arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the level of oppression a day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an administrative procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others analyze these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little action against the disa@@ strous economic crisis , and has preferred to stop critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba .
in the meantime , as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano , as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , said , in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
he began to bear the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , suffered enough .
he kept family sec@@ rec@@ y for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a gendar@@ mer@@ ary . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
records of the archive .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everybody named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . because so my father had raised me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ber of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I joined in and saw a couch where people were tortured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
she r@@ att@@ led a man with cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty v@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it only possible for a person to harm another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated by hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied and tied to the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people were chew@@ ing quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were put to death by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , accused the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be transferred .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the im@@ position of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war of war &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military myself later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war charges are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one removes an enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who put cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do so !
that was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a sco@@ op pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes to his home .
at that time , the defense was accused of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay hold on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last vile act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why should their bodies disappear ?
didn &apos;t these people also have families to hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last vile act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains , of course , always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ gations of all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 I reimbur@@ sed the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally spoken against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court sentenced life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm Jud@@ gement : murder , Tor@@ ture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian personnel .
Pi@@ ero De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years in justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of the people murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the land on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now directed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation defect at a centre in Kyoto where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving license , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 - 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in many ways in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gramm@@ atically not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger talked about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely hope that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) from us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved in accidents in the country , is quite a reason for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the re@@ porter , who was not so named , brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So the translation is not really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills , to understand the original text and learn active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ saving or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , which do not have foreign employees themselves , can still produce translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the sentences handed out by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless . but from large companies or the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online broad@@ caster .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels also transmitted pictures of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that opposed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was connected and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
services such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ GA @-@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer queries of certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds error or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ad as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by C@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ liegende cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
just before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay it is called the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers its under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more enri@@ ching family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work for it , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a treaty which one cannot lift up .
this practice called Cri@@ mean az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and , in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ mean go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , is generally guaranteed to remain silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ mean go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , their daughter , is in the belief that she can finish her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies their exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ mean
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was a cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra entered Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ mean go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ mean go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay could give . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate children &apos;s rights .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be direction @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ mean go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day .
in doing so , she had to take the time to learn that she was still time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was able to bring more books from the library of the owner than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , the host of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ í at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had made possible to lose , they explained .
but it was completely clear to her that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is har@@ ass@@ ment and har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ mean go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the coordinator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the homeland that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the ad switched on once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was closed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testimony from former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conquest , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani and their &quot; wives &quot; ) , so it is not justified to justify that we are still willing to support that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery where they become light sacrifices for abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the provision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ mean go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ six Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted for a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is assigned to permit citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their correct names and ID numbers on their website in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as the &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video directing and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Ministry and a password to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could control physically public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court trial .
this is by no means realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and that no different nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest against protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards who fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and thri@@ ft of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the northeast of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
for this reason , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view that progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in @-@ house in @-@ house , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ u ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the closing light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ees of accommodation establishments ( under the supervision of the under @-@ mentioned , Kaz@@ ak@@ h ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were to be reloc@@ ated to final substitute houses .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , have largely affected agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 % of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by 5@@ 400 hectares of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the inhabitants of the coast , it feels more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her feeling has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper says :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents said that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been moved to permanent spare @-@ houses .
according to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their native pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees , still living in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . it is well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people from other countries speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country borders .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer took him over against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active service until the incident was completed .
the pictures show police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters ha@@ sten to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , we attended the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police traffic gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police arrested on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud speakers .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered road protests by focusing on another unexpected prot@@ agonist : a window wheel .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustrate their titles in an illustr@@ ative way with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window wheel than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also acqu@@ ires an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Del@@ ic@@ ation of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ ers veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds one of the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations agriculture and food organisation .
if present production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same thing : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially auth@@ ored documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ an &apos;s Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was passed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ piece producer has been eradic@@ ated .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the facilities in the communities where they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began medit@@ ating , they also stopped to gr@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories .
they were spar@@ ed .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area there was created a food factory whose production does not even serve for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in retirement at the age of 65 , not because it lacks force , but because it is bitter .

the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ mith@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen of the most indigenous women were disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to teach how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , in spite of the influences caused by globalisation .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved were given a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the face page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ za is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry .
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and as well as go forward with our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the stan@@ za in silver inscription ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin of san@@ pur@@ u ( in the same time , &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies that produce the plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin ma@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food adjustments is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma .
some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly .
our latest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also Rei@@ s@@ b@@ älle ( oni@@ gar@@ gir@@ i ) , Ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ters blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video will give you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin ma@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the missing and abor@@ tions regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings .
the reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each corp@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug trade &quot; ) , which should give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ que que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changes life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who only one day lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them from ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different to it or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ oth@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the Capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month , until they had torn apart their family at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation marked by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him how to cook a egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looks like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was due to organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 murder per day on average .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which he links contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , he fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses were scattered and pla@@ stered corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to the unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be illustrated graphi@@ cally .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
yet another step forward brings personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely portra@@ ys the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ lang also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report released by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the one who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein . in addition , she had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to obtain this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein his statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the sought @-@ after image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private parties , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwarded false reports , some others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also joined together ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries refer to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo was taken from DR Congo as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with the one hand expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a lev@@ elling on what it referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional informed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this position , which has only been published in English , also includes references to fake images of od@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever bli@@ ster outbreak ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which addressed the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar admitted Th@@ ein its 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the now deleted , the Catholic close to the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections with Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ dex@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that allegedly took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the Embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )

frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that perme@@ ate these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ate the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images depic@@ t readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ise emp@@ athy ( such as this study , examining how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g . unmistak@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ break ) .
but all resist stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Res@@ p@@ ect your parents in recognition of how you have stri@@ ved around you in your recent years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the ease or sl@@ oth you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they determined other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an emergency centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and just about hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud winds .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the rainf@@ alls took place on Saturday ( 27th May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly returned .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods drow@@ n the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on their way .
this morning , the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are being made for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ane .
please call today the 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where several social media platforms are fully exploited bring residents in need of security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to restoring norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I joined the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust in her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we will vote for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others cann@@ y slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they sub@@ lim@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , as I do not fit into it , are dra@@ fted .
need to be dra@@ ined
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most often sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come into the mind when you think of him ?
love ?
to make peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western conception , Rum@@ is religion was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been coloni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing pic@@ torial language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman that one should save .
in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American schol@@ ar Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these images continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are still dela@@ ying them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen these powerful , fla@@ wed Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion things belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ abled to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed because seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ affected Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some pocket body , which all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa@@ h W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and false information experts who have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell her , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears a woman down the head@@ scar@@ f .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques all over the USA , see below .

Islam hos@@ tility in its ugly forms attacks our belonging .
it adop@@ ts our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , will see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the ritual with my daughter if I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how decades ago she won a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being a Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - coloni@@ zed by a &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging is to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my dar@@ ing grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the In@@ dependence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was inevitably crying over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the risk of playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time , the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ em@@ ian subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion is deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy comes to the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call for prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion presents more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia in this duality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is targeting mainly Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we shed upon Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , researchers at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous ima@@ gery that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , she had not yet given her ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim today .
things that I left here like a bread crust in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , a story may be l@@ ur@@ king where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations will take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and contained people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination , was even more scientific than Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we had no president who bombar@@ ded chocolate cake while he already sh@@ attered territories and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead fav@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the audience becoming involved .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language no longer is a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fa@@ bel from the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness with a wide gr@@ in : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can come in contact with T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative tours .
Puerto Rico claims of US re @-@ determination of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which tot@@ alled 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic front for the ne@@ ural testing of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves to declining pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , who produces ready @-@ made books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book seeks to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introductory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of extreme extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the Military Police of Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that it had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the world &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would do all it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought the internet to me .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ scription , which she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from the Arabic into English .
the book is available licence @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not care for me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
that I wear with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid farewell
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the monster of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : Director of corruption convic@@ ted by corruption at previous post
Mozambique responded with anger to an incident in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 , and in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za was board between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not execute disciplinary proceedings after his arrest .
however , many people don &apos;t like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the offen@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company apparently remained silent , and did not inc@@ ite appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment .
he could hold paid papers and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence .
contradictory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing morality and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambique ans , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he strongly confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interests , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years away and was free .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took off their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma across the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely pos@@ al con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be linked to racism today , but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ at@@ balls ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it dis@@ solving all the posts that stand in suspicion of racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative notation of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new fac@@ ebook of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and I was not allowed to use the li@@ king , posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions to the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author has shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring these words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also appears as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese lyrics are &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 .
before this change of the marriage network , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a treaty partner of the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention on Children Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to worry about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was adopted - despite the four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for child@@ birth were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which conce@@ als the core of the matter , but do you know what ? children &apos;s mono@@ gam@@ y is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the age @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the plan to am@@ end the marriage network was adopted today , June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all dep@@ uties , who were admitted , voted for the law .
children &apos;s mono@@ gam@@ y is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight against abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Gur@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al Ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was perfectly legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj ple@@ aded against the law , most of the social media users wanted to address the issue differently .
Patricia High@@ ly suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we would say to the state into our bedrooms , would simply specifically talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , will be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

on Sunday the office of the prosec@@ utor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can re@@ visit Wikipedia @-@ contents again
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obs@@ cured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy web users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as posted recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform is still locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform dis@@ continued all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the domain name and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , despite legal prohibition , available .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the messages ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we used to put sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS @-@ platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shot and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for wildlife conservation
a rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then , he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his native place right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ rate situation helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a phone call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to cra@@ ck@@ le pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as terri@@ fying as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already faced Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for fo@@ stering Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this paper was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ hr@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseudo court and rejected by her family and community after having addressed a married relative with her name .
the tradition of calling their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have much less justification to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ sh in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main conversation topic in the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ ba@@ al Campa@@ ign , which is run by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage , to ban@@ ishing HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
to pron@@ ounce the name of her hus@@ bands al@@ oud is a custom that they all maintain their duty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this panel discussion .
at the start , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home as it is going .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us what they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was ki@@ cking only in front of him ; another decided to let the whole insti@@ gate fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head of women : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation took place in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cin@@ ogen@@ ic point on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the cin@@ ogen@@ ic point if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip on every deb@@ ating club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack our lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they are .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa @-@ kur@@ a , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant ; they did not dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the mer@@ its of their own choice of clothing , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper @-@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting started slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tasted it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband again .
some , including myself , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear zinc red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realize they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the right @-@ hand side of the world ( Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day ) in the Japanese t@@ witter @-@ trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ ui@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is celebrated .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
in case you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is celebrated .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also make use of the fan community in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen &apos;s no@@ od@@ les with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are there !
follow the h@@ ash@@ tag on the right @-@ hand side of the watch , in order to learn more about the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day .
bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could target attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trafficking , presumably for dis@@ believers , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ osa , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could contain gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in 2016 to carry out a mission in order to investigate this practice .
persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to go to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police following the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ osa , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ suffered Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ro@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches of the generation .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , suggest@@ ing that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH are ashamed of a country in which the teachers would be ashamed to take sex against good marks , and students would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men would be hun@@ ted for dis@@ believers or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ ro@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald heads :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ ination of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ sels &quot; stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre as a pioneer of the Open Web movement .
and we pay tribute to the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , so the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or enforced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the detained Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to permit him to treat abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised a number of reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit treatment abroad .
Norway for the first time
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon production to China , because exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , urged China to release Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the request of the US embassy was a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the Caribbean
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police are always monitoring the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and get in touch .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada demands China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and Germany
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u on June 29 for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France info reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually record it .
Taiwan in a nut@@ shell
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ Ma@@ i @-@ nu , by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed his concern in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectual and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gge were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who preten@@ ded to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given to his American guests in our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really no answers to his American guests in the final week .
he longed for such questions with non @-@ responses of a rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ hen to make his mind clear since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ hen would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense !
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ hen who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ hen , member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian slip ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister need to pay back invoices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade des Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many of the people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series that will reveal rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series was written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question raised by me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live now and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can easily attach a Canadian flag to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be fun - just like the good , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ worker ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if one wants to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justi@@ n Tru@@ deau acts on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that par@@ o@@ dy the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video refers directly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 liv@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the last three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army &apos;s absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets out a strict punishment against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Most Maj@@ estic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic insul@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is her decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before bringing them into an intern@@ ment warehouse , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they supposedly cause &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ ch@@ uk@@ ho@@ v are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that were all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in my hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left her way to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia collap@@ sed simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once stood , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a small boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of her childhood , which worries about in@@ genu@@ ity in her life .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured ear @-@ rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medicines which they cannot pay , mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ aut ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull the north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead @-@ end street leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar a night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a stove outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers look calm@@ ly on their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone alert in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
in the police inform@@ ing that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network .
this app with min@@ ors &apos; filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published on Twitter , published in China , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the residents to check whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by ro@@ using technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( under the company of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can up@@ lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ ma@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Gä@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything else is gone .
everything has gradually been resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from the inside and from the outside .
one who makes all honor to their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries for death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the earth moves on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ g@@ th . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the head of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own one .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ ming after the power supply ceased to work in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times out of my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that completely fulfilled my expectations .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts talking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look at me and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest possible conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not having a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is still in my nose to this day .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months .
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room .
other than that , they have probably assigned me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoner and must immediately put me on without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , feeling like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
apparently no one of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called the Doctor .
in perfect darkness , no striking fac@@ i@@ ties can be seen in me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all rep@@ lies deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ en on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries arise , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I supervised the inter@@ ro@@ gation and met Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that sli@@ ps him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become accustomed to not answering .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication medium after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man is rejo@@ icing in your scre@@ aming .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ ams .
my cries fell not enough to him , why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the standard equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased to cry .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find any delight at all , which is why he came next to an electrically loaded stick .
electricity f@@ lowed through my whole body , enough to store my entire neighborhood .
my half naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips @-@ li@@ pped lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belongs to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities which range from Damascus to Syria to the very south of San@@ aa .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and he can , according to his own statement , feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special tendency to oppose US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian f@@ lown of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Nes@@ café is dissolved in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam at a hot young jun@@ ta .
basically , the mu@@ gs of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sw@@ wa@@ des of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one throws a glimpse into neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , Jord@@ ani@@ ens Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
several MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ hip Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ uties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which demands the old @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; advocate for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should not be simply shallow rhetor@@ ic , but actually reflected in a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b recovered traditional sex orgas@@ ms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour kill@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of mur@@ der@@ ous or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence can &quot; be detained in@@ definitely in prison &quot; and their release is often necessary for a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee by the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from issues that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was in@@ timi@@ dated by politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b explores the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is again on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a single verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - either faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview with the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service noted several former government officials and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers &apos; Association , argu@@ ing that they had critically commented on the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is confident that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial manner @-@ induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of Neb@@ uta festival .
it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing were handed over more than a thousand years ago and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ary , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
yet for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre truck was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outside appearance and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the out@@ lan@@ dish hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; hair@@ dres@@ ser that has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair sty@@ ling and instead of bad advice an education in hair@@ dressing art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district on which we are very proud because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community .

is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the &quot; Cart@@ as p@@ or la histori@@ li@@ ación &quot; ( letters to reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhetor@@ ic and carried their arms round the clock , must now again integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bians should unite and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more .
he plans , he told him to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would be for@@ given &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all concerned . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ books &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful to me , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC met in a panel discussion .
the students were all raised as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in seclu@@ sion .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice was exer@@ ting on the part of the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca camp , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , wrote the following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ che@@ que on the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that reviewed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she shed light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ ere men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life she ultimately moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; so there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which medical wings were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are old , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful that he has dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February I got threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny &apos;s official television and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has cor@@ rupted not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was too much of my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you feel safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the # 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that is a t@@ abo@@ o issue .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still carry in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to see the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed longer ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no man was arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was hard to wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are even gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves in Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ards had grown .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have allowed this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Defence of Sh@@ aria never even cur@@ led me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long has this time of grace endu@@ red ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change .
he who sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea bags , meetings , I esc@@ ort her to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I do not make a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I dis@@ ap@@ per@@ ated myself .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no coils with them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ es have those who have Kab@@ ard@@ inian , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think at transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong rise in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to come up , so Ah@@ mad &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ mad and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ el@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have heard .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
Iran &apos;s regime den@@ ies Ah@@ mad Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a multitude of dam@@ s , which diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian CEO for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and completed 45 % of a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities in Ah@@ mad and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i and so be employed , since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i have to endure , human rights activists hit the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even expose well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments to me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside .
for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I am suffering twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , racism , black women &apos;s women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ lift their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to say that there is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind , which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ n compla@@ ined : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zed and margin@@ alised being in a historical sense .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to drive forward their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender , as some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join me in the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has reported in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern from the Kurdistan Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ front Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia von E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist located in Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , slightly inde@@ struc@@ tible sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed municipalities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by structural . the article is part of the # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ID bin ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s accurate display also used nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women permit advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit victims of violence should be reported to the law enforcement agencies in general .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation of put@@ ts and statistics
it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available figures are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads filed for domestic violence in the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . in this case , 86 % of the adver@@ ts were reported by women .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said that they were physically mal@@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s secretary Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a private criminal offen@@ se , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . she should regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it just happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a bill was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament on 10 August 2016 , known as # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ali@@ gn@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish tough@@ er as is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law text was changed in some points in order to also attract the dep@@ uties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cover most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply allow ad and wish to secure a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
anyone who is silent about these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are getting offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to allow such a long indication until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had previously been modified , including a passage that the partners called for in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions of the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media still exposed to attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ ate .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he serves a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were also arrested and tried in court .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then he has been suffering from his role as the only sul@@ tan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , the public freedoms , including freedom of the press , to limit and arrest human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate human rights activities systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper where corruption in Oman has been reported since its foundation in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level Political parties to the hands of justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on Ju@@ dges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in a genetic dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties tie hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS concluded the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information issued the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on all roads , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on the publication of the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after being found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , he was released from prison for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i and was released on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he serves his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ al also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Ottoman government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and in which the Minister again ordered the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ inous authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Cuban authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peace , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for locally performed medical research : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he also researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media on this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many salad types he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents per@@ sist not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it needs longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if there was a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I had to yo@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sort of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce at the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested where plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software , providing alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called &quot; Os@@ si &quot; in short , US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed their own varieties , and to avoid it immediately - two aspects , which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
som@@ bre prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Management Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection .
crops play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to not use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely provide their seeds to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is end@@ angers , as the gene pool available is shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only makes it more difficult to use .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones by which their taste or colour improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much more difficult to predict due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property may restrict other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so this protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make work easier for farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of using plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for their cultivation of mass @-@ based her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as those who are active in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , it is the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they decline the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for Sal@@ ate in his vegetable garden .

Mort@@ on also believes breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am more involved with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy to make my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the U.S. seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , carries out an open @-@ source seed program . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and to sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office that grants patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , which should drop the official start @-@ up next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make it clear to people that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it strongly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its objective to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to give up . we insist on further fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , which is also a resident of Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video how the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada comments on the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ tas al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though blocking the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page I was working for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave people go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
document also documented the blocking of providers , possible by embra@@ cing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are being made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .
the Brazilian army is working in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting no@@ ble@@ stone head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ bs pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
so the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on August 16 , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision stated the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are 8@@ 43 areas according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the cru@@ el@@ ties of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than they use ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing about violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra is Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police store and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under attack after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist , Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not match the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this involves entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an in@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war back or forth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the fact that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer from Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a week ago , it is now time that the police declare the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of the shots that the police fired out of a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant fung@@ i
screen@@ shot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ F
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the after@@ math of civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the east Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smu@@ g@@ gled food .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food @-@ saving food &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional food @-@ planted foods in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east of Gh@@ out@@ a .
the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for the last three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining recognition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ oo until Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they were suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i all over the east of Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and around 70 injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state dispute last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , in Portugal alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ ally of the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have passed since the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that enabled the construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val performs in the same article from the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and forth .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt for its own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .

the Way from Afghanistan to Succ@@ ess@@ ful Entrepren@@ eurs

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy was to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was again found in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal mine for a couple of years . the work was hard and made him sick .
once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high welcome rates , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of the asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised units in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fes@@ pan helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was stak@@ ing his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have sprung up , including dres@@ s@@ makers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the dining map of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond Italian hospitality and retail , and return to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffer .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along this path .
ne@@ tizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt allow the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ cane , for more than 900 days in custody .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ tization Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
in order to be able to use the social networks , users must register within six months of the relevant legislative decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the payment of a penalty .
the law , which has been promoted by sixty MPs , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another member of the Parliament reached a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislation , such a deed would be punished with prison sentences and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a date of trial .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the court room according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ cane is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseudo @-@ burden of among others arms possession , illegal convention , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ cep@@ ted on backed @-@ up documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ ro@@ gated to a fully secured action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , endor@@ sed a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all un@@ justi@@ fiable money .
the document published on April 21 on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , indicating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th , as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the People &apos;s Republic of China information offices , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ am@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the Government to take responsibility for the removal of content and to force them upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court dispos@@ es of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has announced that the site has been blocked because it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source cooperating with groups to engage in a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop puff@@ ing around
after this week , the British government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
