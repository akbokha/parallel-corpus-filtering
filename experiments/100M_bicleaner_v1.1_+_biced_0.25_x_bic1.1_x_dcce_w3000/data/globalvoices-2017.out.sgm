<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free of Method Man," "" "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very congenial love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won during the Republican Elections was the highest number ever reached by the nominations nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which absorbs people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trump has also agreed not to agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who was struggling with the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was making his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand people acting and thinking in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise up a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Ü): "as much as the Whites against all other ethnic groups"; white with white in allusions to the Whites and Whiplash, which means so much like whiplash injuries), as the big Van Jones suggests, has killed exactly what America has done so spectacularly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trump a huge part of America's white American promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried out, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocal" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is Trump's land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community have in common in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateuru?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateurah, where the recyclers began to transform parts of the waste into instruments under the leadership of Favio Chavez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all produced from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article published in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateurura, remembers the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced out of apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateurah, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill-fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspirational play from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa at that time it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in liberias before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and slightly inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to hire one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which then expelled the prime ministers from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand by each other where it is about illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. it is also possible to discover suspected driving routes - such as those indicative that a ship will load his captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can, on the basis of this information, refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishment, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD lost in lost turnover, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which is attracting the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying phantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international co-operation and harness the weaknesses of a non-uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You can't attack my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us rather far into networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system which aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishing companies use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross it," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical assistance." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal operating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the location of each tracking vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "meeting with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "v Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without license and had little to reckon with consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year due to illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," states Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member state of Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship travelling under false flag. and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used trawl nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the exercise of office, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by assembling on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the area of Barinas, in the Andean Region of Mérida and Táchira, in the north-eastern province of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the impeachment of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reelection of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the Government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to deprive the country of its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a 12-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, should continue to be blocking the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationally nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all go to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen as well as advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstrator who calls through the shields:" "" "will you kill me because I'm hungry?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter images are piled up which tell about arguments, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some protesters tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardeners do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round, which forms the level of oppression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an administrative procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs for this purpose:</seg>

<seg id="187">Here is your impeachment!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others analyze these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which, from their point of view, has taken little action against the disastrous economic crisis, and has preferred to stop critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike, instead of working or shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, as an adult man, Quijano, as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process, said, in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">He began to bear the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept family secrecy for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a gendarmerary. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records of the archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos's son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was divided in many ways in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger talked about the apologies:</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awfully" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are involved in accidents in the country, is quite a reason for concern." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills, to understand the original text and learn active language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-saving or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, which do not have foreign employees themselves, can still produce translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sentences handed out by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless. but from large companies or the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also transmitted pictures of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that opposed the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the parliament's duties to the executive and Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was connected and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEGA-intro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer queries of certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds error or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a report by Ctural, which is published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Fliegende cows, decaying schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay it is called the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers its underage son or her underage daughter to another, more enriching family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework for it, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a treaty which one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Crimean azgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and, in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Crimean go - collected testimonies, researching and denouncing.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is inoculated with the Criadita, is generally guaranteed to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crimean go is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, their daughter, is in the belief that she can finish her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with him and justifies their exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was a criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira entered Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practice of Crimean go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Crimean go as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there" "" "no more Carolina" "" "in Paraguay could give." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate children's rights.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be direction-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Crimean go comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to take the time to learn that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't have unlimited food." "" "I was able to bring more books from the library of the owner than food from the fridge," "" "she recalls." ""</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings, the host of Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her not to believe the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would learn" bad habits "there again." they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would speak their native language Guaraní at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had made possible to lose, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="474">But it was completely clear to her that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">In school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated. "one thing that is almost never talked about is harassment and harassment that Criaditas are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the Spanish conquest, the Conquistadores, the women of Guarani and their "wives"), so it is not justified to justify that we are still willing to support that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery where they become light sacrifices for abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their correct names and ID numbers on their website in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill consisting of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as the "jedwede application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video directing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Telecommunications Ministry and a password to get through the firewall blocking Facebook. "</seg>

<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "leading research technologist") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they could control physically public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and that no different narration is present on the surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legal action against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening "public order" and "protest against protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards who fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and thrift of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the northeast of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this reason, the prefecture Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view that progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in-house in-house, saigai kouei juu aku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the closing light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the disaster, evacuees of accommodation establishments (under the supervision of the under-mentioned, Kazakh juutaku) were to be relocated to final substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures, have largely affected agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66% of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed by 5400 hectares of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the inhabitants of the coast, it feels more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her feeling has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper says:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents said that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been moved to permanent spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their native prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the evacuees, still living in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. it is well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalme, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldiers veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds one of the fact that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Agricultural prospects" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations agriculture and food organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same thing: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially authored documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulan's Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was passed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was opposed to his will at the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped build.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it with hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsummithum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen of the most indigenous women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to teach how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, in spite of the influences caused by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the face page of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and as well as go forward with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the stanza in silver inscription (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin of sanpuru (in the same time, "Plastics models of the dishes") of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies that produce the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomas, the blogger inii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin mapuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food adjustments is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members pleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also Reisbälle (onigargiri), Earrings and Handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matters blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video will give you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin mapuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trade" in Mexico, the missing and abortions regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with the drug trade"), which should give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vique que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changes life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs every weekend after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who only one day lost their father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent to it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soothed" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" "" "Four months of extortion in the Capital district: how a family was plundered with threats." "" "she describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month, until they had torn apart their family at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" "" "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation marked by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him how to cook a egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was due to organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murder per day on average.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was repeated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a man to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be illustrated graphically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misconceptions; Africa Check has documented assignment to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step forward brings personal comments, such as this example falsely portrays the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Slang also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report released by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the one who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claimed in 2012, the President of Myanmar's Thein. in addition, she had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to obtain this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (framing) that permeate these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are umpteen people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliate the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images depict readers and viewers and take the ability to empathise empathy (such as this study, examining how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) endeavours to provide language enthusiasts with a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudades) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobreak).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubborn every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Respect your parents in recognition of how you have strived around you in your recent years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the ease or sloth you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They determined other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish even more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They sublimate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims, as I do not fit into it, are drafted.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Need to be drained</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most often sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">As Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western conception, Rumis religion was wiped out, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing pictorial language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman that one should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">In the 1970s, the pioneering Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said shattered the story behind these images.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood are still delaying them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful, flawed Narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades, while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi Arabia, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1030">It seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who were hijacked with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flawed that often Sikh-men and children are becoming the target of anti-militarist attacks and harassings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion things belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives that help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is fabled to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead favours" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and representation lead to the audience becoming involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language no longer is a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the fabel from the rabbit and the baboon in Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his" "" "fable" "", "John Nyamara asks:" "" "how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "he shares his sense of inclusiveness with a wide grin:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those inspired by the project can come in contact with TLS to organize their own story narrative tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which totalled 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Mexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civic front for the neural testing of debt) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debts are accountable for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer, Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event of the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, who produces ready-made books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here royalty free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book seeks to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of extreme extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the Military Police of Bassel had taken part in Adra as a "strictly secret" command of the military court. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the world's cultural prototypes was more prescient than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would do all it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripe in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proscription, which she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available licence-free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the contemplation in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers does not care for me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guards</seg>

<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and smile.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of corruption convicted by corruption at previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to an incident in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008, and in 2010 together with four other defendants was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice Cambaza was board between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not execute disciplinary proceedings after his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the offending." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent, and did not incite appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid papers and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn't have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morality and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, to remind a thief in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Mahel will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mosambique ans, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he strongly confirmed that "an ambitious man was capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interests, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not the case. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took off their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still debated, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burmese" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma across the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely posal connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be linked to racism today, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spatballs), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it dissolving all the posts that stand in suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative notation of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new facebook of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and I was not allowed to use the liking, posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions to the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author has shared his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring these words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also appears as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese lyrics are "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail that contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to incite violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage network, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there came to a great public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, since that, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a treaty partner of the UN" "" "Convention on Children Rights" "", "the minors are defined as" "" "every man under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were eager to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to worry about their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was adopted - despite the four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who abstained - so that he could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for childbirth were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which conceals the core of the matter, but do you know what? children's monogamy is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and this is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentro-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torture Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group which openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-ready age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The plan to amend the marriage network was adopted today, June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies, who were admitted, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children's monogamy is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight against abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Guraj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al Rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was perfectly legitimate, if Maharaj pleaded against the law, most of the social media users wanted to address the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Highly suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we would say to the state into our bedrooms, would simply specifically talk about the fact that the state, our daughters, will be abused by large, hard-boiled men, who are opposed to them, "would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can revisit Wikipedia-contents again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy web users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as posted recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform is still locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform discontinued all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (calculator), which is not based on the domain name and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, despite legal prohibition, available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the messages (via the locking of Wikipedia), we used to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS-platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshot and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as collaborators with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then, he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his native place right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-rate situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a phone call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as terrifying as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he had already faced Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for fostering Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This paper was written by Kayonaaz Kalyhra and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of consequences, they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo court and rejected by her family and community after having addressed a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of calling their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have much less justification to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walsh in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main conversation topic in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # Khelbaal Campaign, which is run by the Community of Video Volunteers and sets up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage, to banishing HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the name of her husbands aloud is a custom that they all maintain their duty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the start, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home as it is going.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini launched her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us what they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was kicking only in front of him; another decided to let the whole instigate frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head of women: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation took place in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cinogenic point on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the cinogenic point if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are doing a trip on every debating club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack our lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa-kura, a wide shirt over a pant; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the merits of their own choice of clothing, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper-shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to go on a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are getting started slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband again.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear zinc red on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realize they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the hashtag was to be found in the right-hand side of the world (Beatles commemorative day) in the Japanese twitter-trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"" "the cult band's music is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review." ""</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles commemorative day is in Japan. at the age of 51, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today the Beatles commemorative day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese of course also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In case you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today the Beatles commemorative day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also make use of the fan community in terms of market conditions, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles commemorative day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat Ramen's noodles with my mother" "" "Mutaro Koya" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping people for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelievers, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milosa, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a man-headed man could contain gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN in 2016 to carry out a mission in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of single-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrobala, Province of Zambézia, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches of the generation.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blog's poor Snaippa on Facebook, suggesting that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after he participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to permit him to treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised a number of reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway for the first time</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon production to China, because exports were mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, urged China to release Lius as she announced in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad informed that the Americans" "" "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad so far as he can help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US embassy was a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the Caribbean</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police are always monitoring the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and get in touch.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada demands China to uphold its international human rights obligations including freedom of expression and freedom of expression." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and Germany</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu on June 29 for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in a nutshell</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of landlords in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mai-nu, by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed his concern in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and stated that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectual and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmug, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugge were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretended to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given to his American guests in our press, our judiciary, our political system were really no answers to his American guests in the final week.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He longed for such questions with non-responses of a rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmuhen to make his mind clear since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmuhen would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said Singapore was not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuhen who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmuhen, member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "believed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian slip?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister need to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>

<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if one wants to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, released a music video that parody the Junta, which seized power in 2014, and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers directly to the ongoing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially in the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may relate to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the Commander-in-Chief of the Army's absolute decision-making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the junta continues to pursue is her decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before bringing them into an internment warehouse, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they supposedly cause "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has amounted to 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold-coloured ear-rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars a night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medicines which they cannot pay, massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead-end street leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar a night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a stove outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single-educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers look calmly on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by twitter-user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone alert in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private chat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police informing that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors' filters is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" published on Twitter, published in China, published the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the residents to check whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rousing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (under the company of "" "" ew "" "") also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can uplift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urummais's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slumps to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips-lipped lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belongs to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fellowyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities which range from Damascus to Syria to the very south of Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and he can, according to his own statement, feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special tendency to oppose US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian flown of the second generation," he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while the Nescafé is dissolved in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam at a hot young junta.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the mugs of lukewarm coffee and the swwades of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one throws a glimpse into neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordaniens Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Several MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontship Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert message.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "straight" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which demands the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "advocate for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflected in a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional sex orgasms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years Jordan has increased the number of" "" "honour killers" "" "- the unofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honor morals reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murderous or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence can "be detained indefinitely in prison" and their release is often necessary for a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee by the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was intimidated by politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib explores the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is again on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a single verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words, "get what you want" - either faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview with the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even more recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service noted several former government officials and members of the Teachers' Association, arguing that they had critically commented on the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib sees - is made up of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is confident that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial manner-induced democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing were handed over more than a thousand years ago and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched to the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissary, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Yet for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metre truck was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and personal care have rarely been as important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the outlandish hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the "Batalla de Barberos" hairdresser that has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair styling and instead of bad advice an education in hairdressing art that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district on which we are very proud because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the paper" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the "Cartas por la historiliación" (letters to reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces) that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "before the Colombian people, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms round the clock, must now again integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians should unite and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans, he told him to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all concerned. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambooks" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke to him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful to me, so I answer it." "" "then suddenly the tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC met in a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as already war and the FARC already acted in seclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice was exerting on the part of the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the Caldono-Cauca camp, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, wrote the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damoklescheque on the local LGBTQ community has not only emerged overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that reviewed the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she shed light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queere men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grozny's official television and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>

<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, there was a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>

<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that is a taboo issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to see the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed longer?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no man was arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan was hard to wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even gay men arrested in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves in Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I was still there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer then.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>

<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Sharia never even curled me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't mess about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long has this time of grace endured?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiled and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea bags, meetings, I escort her to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not make a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I disapperated myself.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have those who have Kabardinian, the Russians also have; on the whole planet they are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think at transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahvtsi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in Ahraz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to come up, so Ahmad's human rights groups who want to work in Ahmad and remain anonymous.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz.</seg>

<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahvtsi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazelwi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have heard.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahvtsi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of dams, which divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian CEO for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and completed 45% of a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities in Ahmad and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab Ahvtsi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahvtsi and so be employed, since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahvtsi have to endure, human rights activists hit the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - are with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even expose well-thought out scientific and social arguments to me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin color, racism, black women's women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "uplift their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that there is in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalised form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind, which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourn complained: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanized and marginalised being in a historical sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to drive forward their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender, as some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join me in the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most of the names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissar said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, Ada Báez's accurate display also used nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women permit advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit victims of violence should be reported to the law enforcement agencies in general.</seg>

"there are different statements and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads filed for domestic violence in the District Prosecutor's Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts. in this case, 86% of the adverts were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said that they were physically maltreated, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's secretary Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this" "", "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a private criminal offense, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. she should regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it just happened to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had insulted her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreating them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an immanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">A bill was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament on 10 August 2016, known as # Porelas (# fürst) under the hashtag # Porelas.</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Aligness) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain Feminid to an independent criminal offense and to punish tougher as is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the law text was changed in some points in order to also attract the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is denied, which is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cover most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at present, if they simply allow ad and wish to secure a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Anyone who is silent about these facts is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are getting offended.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to allow such a long indication until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted at the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had previously been modified, including a passage that the partners called for in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions of the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the domestic secrecy, the public freedoms, including freedom of the press, to limit and arrest human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities limit peaceful and legitimate human rights activities systematically and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for locally performed medical research: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a far more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he also researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Sámi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media on this research.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many salad types he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents persist not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it needs longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's as if there was a boulder in a river that I had to yodel." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new sort of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman lettuce at the Outredgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it is tested where plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "open-source" "" "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software, providing alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called "Ossi" in short, US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed their own varieties, and to avoid it immediately - two aspects, which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Sombre prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Management Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Crops play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to not use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed industry, whose recent examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016." whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely provide their seeds to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangers, as the gene pool available is shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only makes it more difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones by which their taste or colour improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much more difficult to predict due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property may restrict other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "so this protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make work easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton interferes with the concept of using plant features:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of mass-based herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as those who are active in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, it is the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they decline the patenting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his vegetable garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am more involved with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still the Egyptian authorities lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it strongly criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its objective to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to give up. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Qatar because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website locks to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for non-accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is also a resident of Canada's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video how the police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada comments on the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdeltas al-Sisi; and even though blocking the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave people go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Document also documented the blocking of providers, possible by embracing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block web pages that VPNs offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are being made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army is working in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting noblestone headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robs pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the newspaper "Extra" published in Rio for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on August 16, "This is not normal," in which it announced to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision stated the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are 843 areas according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the cruelties of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the designation" "" "war" "" "harm more than they use?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira is arguing about violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2779">When we look at the morals per state, Rio is in place 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra is Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police store and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years now, the UPP has become increasingly under attack after several reports of chicanes and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist, João Paulo Charleaux, quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not match the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this involves entering into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an insharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">"" "" "" "war back or forth" "" "is the fact that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer from Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, it is now time that the police declare the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of the shots that the police fired out of a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "" "food-saving food" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and around 70 injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state dispute last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, in Portugal alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soverally of the Confederation of farmers of Portugal declared Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">According to Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fire.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law that enabled the construction activity if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval performs in the same article from the paper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread further and forth.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as citizens seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used fogos.pt for its own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website was more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy was to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been assassinated by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf was again found in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a couple of years. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high welcome rates, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of the asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres." "" "these are improvised units in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifespan helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf was staking his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghans have sprung up, including dressmakers, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The dining map of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also are Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs's goals, however, extend far beyond Italian hospitality and retail, and return to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "said Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also plans plans to open a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and canning techniques. "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netization Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use the social networks, users must register within six months of the relevant legislative decision on the website of the authority, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by sixty MPs, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another member of the Parliament reached a legislative proposal in which tougher penalties would be introduced for the insult of the president or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislation, such a deed would be punished with prison sentences and fines, such as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just like more than 700 protesters arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a date of trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed until 20 May, because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the court room according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawcane is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-burden of among others arms possession, illegal convention, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage of pro-Morsi seating blockade at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists intercepted on backed-up documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has mainly been interrogated to a fully secured action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, endorsed a controversial bill of law, which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they return all unjustifiable money.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on Nawaat's website sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the legal situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources, indicating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th, as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the People's Republic of China information offices, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Rosamnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the provincial government as the" "" "organiser of disseminating information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the Government to take responsibility for the removal of content and to force them upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclasniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop puffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the British government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telcos and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
