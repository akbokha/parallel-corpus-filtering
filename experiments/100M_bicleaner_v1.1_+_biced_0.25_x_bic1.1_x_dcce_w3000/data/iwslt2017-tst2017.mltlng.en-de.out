this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the NSA had heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous investig@@ ators did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had been indications for years that it was essential for their fall , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the era of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly dispos@@ ed of his telephone certificates ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens suspect source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional comment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today , there are communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous known Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any regular contact form .
these are then encrypted and saved on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to discover mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveals that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we received news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous business . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and mask their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were not so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip school@@ children .
che@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers are allowed to rip off particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring the suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked everyone to make suggestions to our investig@@ ator how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very vile as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last few years we have seen violations of transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been living in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the in@@ convenient facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency that allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I stepped out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the tips of tens to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me is hanging in his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap of time , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and established so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes bon@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite other foreign people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to light .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet touch of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
that &apos;s how most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have imagined once with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand in your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and housing .
little surprising we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what subjects to write about .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not previously covered .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated overnight stays ever had a problem .
for people trust one another .
when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
they leave one even longer stay without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships beyond the pure money transaction are exactly what we want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to name it now simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not do justice to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are expos@@ ing a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays it is comparable to fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place that you visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood in a pub that you never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from scratch to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared parti@@ ality ?
I imagine cities that allow us to establish society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking lots belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were con@@ veys to people whose children were moved out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . overnight 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it has been taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da comes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born this way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then , it was a feminist agreement for independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted , and ultimately thought .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ne@@ ar pedi@@ gree ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building up .
I remember , as we were going sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t swallow up . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings ran : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I watched the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims to free up and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I threw the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking spaces , but not to stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque helps to see people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radi@@ cal@@ isation process one has found out that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the person believes the extre@@ mi@@ sts are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or ab@@ hor@@ red by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to the world of imagination , if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their reasons for their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one throws a glance at them , it does not lead them to what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister that she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised to find a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her fur@@ y , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one study shows : if you submit to test subjects in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood strikes against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective blame , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited the afternoon .
he fired eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely pursue our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw caused me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who may claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy think tank , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air supply vent@@ ures into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they started to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air units reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine location in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an air@@ liner that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of h@@ edge star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ liner doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often present basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely @-@ controlled flying machines , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life a lot happens so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the odds of getting it right when everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is actually symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
this gives him the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited .
we will demonstrate this now by making half the fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth second in pure energy .
this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
first of all , we arrange events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , especially multi @-@ zel@@ liges was born on the earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately due to col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes tra@@ ded through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ formation in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers teach in courses to rel@@ ativity theory often a properly structured dance .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even laugh@@ able .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and au@@ st@@ led when hitting the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus , which is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott like to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics like tone and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make easy pictures of objects in space with them .
but by listening to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard Fol@@ lowing : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear will recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns circul@@ ating one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or in principle -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that things exist in space that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first run that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes , so to speak , are the bones of the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our arch@@ eological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I begin to play with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear removed .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my bill of bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I realized that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , bring you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ amed on TV . I produce television .
I make TV , in a large style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four times four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , 4 times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are Shows I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard as you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when talking about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just typing in the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
as if one is dreaming of a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the hum@@ ming , I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working and working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz@@ ing , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing , then you can do no different than for size .
the feeling of not being different from striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to clarify one thing : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the bu@@ zz@@ ing . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same ti@@ ter work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeping not , not giving up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refuse , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you do , you love what you do , be a teacher , be a ban@@ ker , to be a mother , to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and you know how the hum@@ ming feels when you stop the bu@@ zz@@ ing , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and I &apos;m getting my money out , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sleep , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; let go .
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the amount of titanium , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real hum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough for me to work like that .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a human being prefers to be more than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of it .
we hur@@ ried around in the garden , before and behind , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
and if my teen @-@ daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can bring them up for 15 minutes , even on a bad @-@ whi@@ m @-@ day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting drunk .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes at the end , why not allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
work is not working without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my sum now .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I listen to the bu@@ zz . the country that I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz , the other , the real hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more me !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
for sure , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one implant@@ ing an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered heavy trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is sw@@ inging to the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , one has to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to make cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François survived .
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we ple@@ aded with the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we pl@@ ung@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we wound up an injury and mat@@ ured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grow to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ ung@@ ed .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we hurt the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it was about people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see , when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal ourselves .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; father Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest hind@@ ran@@ ces are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy fa@@ des with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who told me that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ he@@ v , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group will be er@@ ron@@ eous , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are m@@ owed , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that throws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who , however , are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and contribute income that could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity is desper@@ ately needed , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time was lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a final loop promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , out of fear , would be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily bound up the circumstances that cause the body to kill him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his very wast@@ eful type@@ .@@ All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many of course --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing in ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that it emp@@ tied the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and more decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of the state of state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our modern demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually advancing the policy and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not in a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics has mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which she nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end she star@@ ved .
similarly , it is with the economy that has tou@@ red politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality is rising , the general economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher are the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the expul@@ sion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the extravag@@ ance of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; society , in which machines are used to serve human beings and human beings feed their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is followed by a job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no upward twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time the liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a matrix - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers &quot; means &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is thoroughly relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also totally mad .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not mad , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the or@@ ators you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most is happening -- the area of the economy -- is a totally democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now accused of doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance in Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us , and the perpet@@ ual denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Europe group , continue to have chosen the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s Troika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive dialogue of the talks , you seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone face comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me it will be as intol@@ erable for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price though he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ gel hair@@ cut and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for visiting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a highly competitive industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the bend because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium size , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and by analy@@ sing eight candidates for TV shows , he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon releases things for free , you get access to it , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the ratings they give the shows they show the shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when one collects millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimized it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time where we can use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data se@@ dated companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we would rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as deciding for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful choices .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , disman@@ tle this problem into its components , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it all : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to conclude a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intel@@ lect wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but deciding how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question , you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
