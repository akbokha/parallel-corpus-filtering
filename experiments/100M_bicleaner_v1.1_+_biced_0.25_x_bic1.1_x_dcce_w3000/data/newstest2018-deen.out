Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a chapel , now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the one @-@ time basis of farmers .
the oldest official map Munich supports exciting stories for days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but precisely therefore very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work which is not recognized as such .
the large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called prim@@ eval sheets .
these were developed according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French military leader occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Max IV . Joseph further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian sur@@ veying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ position blatt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comparison of former times / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is the sub @-@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after the creation of the card , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as Munich subur@@ b .
today , the city is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : the zo@@ oming appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive recording &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are no more farmers in this area , but small farmers in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , the scene of the October Festival , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen it is not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or on the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has been engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place had been , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ ced@@ ony plant in Haar ( 1905 ) .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people now meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the premises of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east is located to the west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house - built in architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original building of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ vine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bom@@ bers tore up many holes in the inner city .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day was the pre@@ occupation and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the slider the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention on trips through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities who dispro@@ portion@@ ately to minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an abundance that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which shows that black mot@@ orists are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites in the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring cow@@ ards or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of injuries to the 16th rate of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ br@@ n project is a project for success and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary dep@@ uties Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bach CD@@ U place together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties met at the right @-@ gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este falls exclusively region@@ ales .
since he is also the B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot;
I can not profit@@ ably manage on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land provision for a lot of work , much must be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical pesticides and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it did not lead to a biogas plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the subsidies , farmers are often critic@@ ised
in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els of eleven participants were fenced .
the open @-@ ment area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 .
one half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers fence @-@ fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Gro@@ wing Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will allow the state support for gra@@ zing f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a subsi@@ dy outlined by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area that can be fenced off must not be in@@ efficient ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ reluct@@ ance Project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ air area covers 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp opens the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged over@@ throwing of Saddam Hussein at the company &apos;s Plaza in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ itations would have sm@@ elled him if he had done it .
but he picked up its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring say@@ ings of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your afflicted masses , longing to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical figur@@ ative representation .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great scre@@ aming R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame to the re@@ formed world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective of Miller and Tru@@ mp ever to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent on the World Championship will &quot; make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special has developed &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : there &apos;s something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Tom Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is pretty modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made of course were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to watch the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games after a great season .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell team .
the team captain says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the dial of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he le@@ ap@@ ed in the criticism , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and de@@ fer his ha@@ iry head for chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is called official , and of employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful folks who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ ps .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers tac@@ kled his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , over@@ came his post , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who was leading up to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field last year before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year are coming back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are caused by passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground there is much ver@@ berge , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which again and again obstruc@@ ts construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off filters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her log cabin in En@@ try@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is picked up and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 the Province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island .
the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrugated iron , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper at a value of 3.1 billion dollars .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at US $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 of Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
massac@@ res in the tribal area of Pap@@ u@@ as in the 1970 &quot; s were filed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All Se@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai Local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the native of Papua , the m@@ um mother of Papua ( the women &#93; of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised during his campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including P@@ ani@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Guinea has changed little , and today people feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai died only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ try@@ ali when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers began their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their guns , said the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in a circle continuously and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began hur@@ ting stones at police and military out@@ posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ carot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ingly imp@@ u@@ dence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in P@@ ani@@ ai &apos;s neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers involved to hold accoun@@ tability and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ani@@ ai was always an in@@ security for the Indon@@ esian government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal family Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by insti@@ lling spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in inf@@ ra @-@ red is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ aries and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native countries of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the board of the board of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting are subject to international media coverage .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua New Guinea due to lack of coordination with related institutions , despite their rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the P@@ ani@@ ai Sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ ha@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r , dismissed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the session but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has yet another presidential election , but the Papua state that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai pe@@ an@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai s@@ uss@@ les offered a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget the perpetr@@ ators of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called coinci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who called his name George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fires at 4 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the greatest part of the damage from facing , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has been pleased with his great Davis Cup coup during the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of profits , waf@@ ting thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ set @-@ classics stay the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scarcely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the overall reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
even after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , it was not until the vote that the finale should be carried out at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places , etc . , will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds a pol@@ l
a survey conducted by passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited objects at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had late discovered that they had been mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent which were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were pur@@ ged by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent admitted knowing know@@ ingly objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods were brought by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly wear smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could regard books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .

&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has assumed that part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever more trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less brilliant number when announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la is paying the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Form . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , m@@ aus@@ ed mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
the Tes@@ la boss , however , does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 is expected - all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently being made per day .
anyone who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major disrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , then the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent uns@@ atis@@ factory customers from running away in flocks .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ trac@@ ts due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a deadline which expi@@ red on October 1st for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for O@@ zone O@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , has long been a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory escal@@ ation agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to deadlines for execution and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish an appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority we give to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the position of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive introduction of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York was in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people , and every year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ itts with surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ us celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade at 4.@@ 30@@ pm on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ l@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle were first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ gent @-@ buch . count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the hill of the hill , apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still recognizable today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third , the noble sett@@ ler nucleus of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lined by these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly acquired bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from hearing @-@ sweat .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower @-@ value existing today remained a witness to the 750 year old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
organizers invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ l@@ gens on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is formed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Vor@@ steh@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery for the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows going to the woods , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers highlight the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius line , which is of importance for tumours and listeners .
friends and sponsors of Tum@@ l@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow authorisation of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim for@@ bid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned towards the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim for@@ bid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; pollution &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before by a change in the land use plan - but the district government in Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to lack of planning , the granted permit is still illegal and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided on the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of ground .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four grown households .
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
auto and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally injured .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will raise customers awareness of what offers the city &apos;s own city apart from the usual grocery store .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are said to invite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to actively participate .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or re @-@ developed .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had spread broad@@ ly , King had said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his own direct environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school
during construction there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
during a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade on Wednesday ( local time ) , an injured person was in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first miss was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as an accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people lived in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after pier@@ ced tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico , Tru@@ mp was under pressure because of the payment of the border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President ap@@ plau@@ ded him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia is &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists dec@@ eive rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped forward with rif@@ les to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked scanning through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates sw@@ am in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am sh@@ attered the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene played on July 22nd , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all of them in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt patch on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life long civil law@@ man .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice never has been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays down a blanket over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI acts received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain free for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in summer .
about the same time as the choice stood according to the FBI specification , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they went away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes with an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in murder , removed evidence and has covered the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many people want to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pressed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bell@@ gh is a gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bell@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room were the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who played Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and drives him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ k from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ asti@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compani@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he tells it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed with a grief @-@ dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays in@@ trau@@ matic lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children squ@@ at at their heads , register the f@@ aked blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ uring a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bell@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ un embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ters about the im@@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emphasis is in some ways inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner community in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f presents a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ floor setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a stre@@ amed street corner with Wall Street and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Poster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rh@@ en@@ ols pose as rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed o@@ il@@ barrels remind of Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously nasty Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a heavy weight box@@ ers .

later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ med stor@@ m@@ ingly , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to have a g@@ ossi@@ p of the Pfei@@ f@@ concert , five years later , when the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it was also an understanding of his point of view grown .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work right in several places during their volunte@@ ering year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open full@@ day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a bel@@ ated volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made S@@ LC .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focus perhaps also , really .
and was it so ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing for me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in contrast to civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about counting extras .
there are always other people who have a different story behind them .
whether a fu@@ gi@@ tive , whether a youth , who has been taken out of the family - you have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is that way .
Pear@@ son cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the breakdown of jobs , the general director of John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 positions have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after the first half @-@ year achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bomb attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato it means that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoner of impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable condition and treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops re@@ pressed the Taliban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aling that the states are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday that the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it would show the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured to specify where cuts need to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia bor@@ ough , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have caused the demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups to worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two opposing votes , the com@@ mon@@ der@@ at of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ cken decides the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home .
in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it would still be time for the area belonging to the church community to be part of the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the congregation .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the common council are ho@@ vering above such a common space as a meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the environment @-@ construction - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - is possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks of this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which one cannot move so quite well , but now they rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any asset or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but gets a real counter @-@ value , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to apply the proposed resolution accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing votes to the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and badly injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from Hil@@ den in the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him prim@@ acy .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove up the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he met with a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch car .
FC Bayern Munich must rel@@ inqu@@ ish at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ age
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with staff worries , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff at the German Football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti also has to do without the BV@@ B with the BA@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
there are also Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ers , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football wei@@ ght@@ ings captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , shared the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planetary route in Göttingen ( since 2003 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ry path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the information needs of many har@@ z@@ men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible Install@@ ations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inqu@@ ires St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be added via the internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Ticket to Ride will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ ry , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why one star sh@@ one more strongly than another , although much further away .
it is also taught in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the Berg@@ stad@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s path since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ d &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inner of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to to the d@@ warf @-@ planets at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distance is about 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is a good four kilometres .
while the light is needed from Sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next star would still last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion who went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ s &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he has to move to lightweight @-@ weight @-@ counter &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could happen in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a huge fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko listened to Gar@@ cia with a generous praise and said he thinks the three combat champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for its own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four pen@@ alties for tire plat@@ ters
in the event of an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it turned over and then lay on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , and then traffic could be passed on the left lane on the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain chain is designed to be further optimized .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off doesn &apos;t want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one stands beside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in preparing the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ wheel chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we &apos;re in the three @-@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we are able to harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many playing mistakes in the construction process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can speak about a failure of a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know about that .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a favorite hit in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defense of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favourite on Sunday go to the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday in no case .
new findings of Sweden &apos;s asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden that have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medical Medical Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
they are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Network ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under the age of age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent out 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency rated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the results published in 5@@ 81 , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , x @-@ ray of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the way of measuring should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work started at the same time on all three buildings requiring renovation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction site is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ developed .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach arrived on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called bridge cap .
this is a border fixation that is also used as an operating mode .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should proceed .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented brid@@ ge@@ heads .
particular finger@@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also an optical cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collection @-@ house in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ging ani@@ z@@ ations amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : in protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag party ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; great campaign opening act &quot; according to the poster .
and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the German elections on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prim@@ eval potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ me reports about the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well the Ro@@ un@@ del , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the Parliament election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy head of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ listening with the wolf tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is how Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo orchestra of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach res@@ ig@@ ns with the two as in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m mixes classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating total artwork .
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dis@@ regarded bit@@ terly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette present@@ er ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered particularly as she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to declare her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call myself ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have moved away from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp had previously announced a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal mine from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a statement in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , in@@ vigor@@ ating message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sorry for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday , describing what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be re @-@ entered into the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for all the athletes who were taken away from gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted on the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ install Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trage@@ dies for soldiers em@@ bos@@ sed in Mali
during a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
still un@@ explained , Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two in@@ verse pilots but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from North Hessen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday , accompanied by a dead watch from the Bundes@@ wehr .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the mour@@ ning ceremony began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives were standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flying operation of the tiger helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali were not shown by the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife .
this shared the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to reign .
in 2016 he retired and also rec@@ alled the title of &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to make a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to res@@ ign after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday he spoke for the dissolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MP from her parliament faction in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen co@@ ined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants his group to welcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must decide now whether to go@@ vern this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ects the trust and el@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities need to be legally clean@@ ly tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ en &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she returns her country mandate , which she received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the Pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences of content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est from Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MP in Lower Saxony is not just a betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of Western Australia costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her final vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony with@@ drew this dirty intri@@ gue and tried to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his dep@@ uties to accept El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the West of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts .
at that time the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the Parliament &apos;s day .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers be protected ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know presently , a health endanger@@ ing is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has switched on without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ may . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
if the return level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the companies are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies are not responsible for immediate debt .
on the contrary , due to the presum@@ ption of illegal practices of service companies , they must reck@@ on with economic damages .
as always , there are too few controllers in the seri@@ ousness .
is it missing only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be met are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and competitive food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ ted funds manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ medi@@ ating animals cannot be tolerated and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the relevant authorities that the facts are spe@@ edi@@ ly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can easily make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must act with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their soccer @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , she can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments made by the 2022 World Cup Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be ambassador and a such maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports published show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small recycled sho@@ cks of 14 grams distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers before landing .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
the Swiss don &apos;t want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aims to renew the treaty over the spring of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss chocolate boards have been distributing their flights on board the Swiss since 2006 .
before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo was Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class passengers scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael show alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels as if time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that shu@@ ff@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character crosses an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil P@@ lot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ et of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could appeal to this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang footage of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon recalls the revival of the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring battle icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ seated Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ sus - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends time to watch chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ arranged for a shorter length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feast for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blows against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the Land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have done a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
officials also provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two persons were arrested during the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
altogether more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
already since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .
there was a lively exchange between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , Wednesday morning the great deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
ways allow large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , atten@@ tively drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in cases of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has received .
according to data , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 susp@@ ects in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data was not maintained sufficiently , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , dates have been found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false attri@@ butions have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugees to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they immig@@ rated from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the newspaper , pointing to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening human @-@ illegal recording conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the fla@@ ws in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
all ahead Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations meanwhile , now 50 litres of blood distributed .
traditionally , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it , and we give respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the leader of the German Red Cross ( D@@ RK ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ons are broken into their components .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .
already before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry numbered among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ gel@@ , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members seeking a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened support for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its forecast forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the domestic income would continue , while inflation is expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alised that in the next few years interest rates would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it will now be expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak in the short term because the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , she reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ asted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % predicted in May and 1.7 % .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound was after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for a rate of interest and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth will be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the end of the year .
the latest inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and slight increase in wages , since the tightening is made worse at first before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income arri@@ vals in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will recover considerably at the end of their three year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest has increased since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in proportion to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the len@@ ders are vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ously looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and take out the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to ag@@ itate controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the financing of the drug at the N@@ HS in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England admitted that a pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the past year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens welcomed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement procedure .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow minister of health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to maximize the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling wasn &apos;t big enough to place two rooms together , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed together without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored on both ends to last longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering was involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ productive , so it is very easy when you push the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing by good design and increased square footage of slightly standard .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave it .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ al@@ isms of Victori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp controversy over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record says that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - what Col@@ in claims , as Paul claims to have expelled him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul above to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early monkey painting , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delic@@ at@@ essen transactions dating from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the Brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held a lot , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and following a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media made contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp appointed new Chief of Staff to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House which he wanted to fix : bad information that was put into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said to the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed for unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February facing Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp &apos;s habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp controversy coming out .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide a dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful ch@@ equ@@ es , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone malicious a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson is permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started questioning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ sh &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped .
the police across Europe will send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , information from the population will be raised and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent cal@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting to holiday destinations were hiding , called it by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for the sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online applications could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of clu@@ es after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn up by the community to rec@@ laim a field from their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they had been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back now .
more came last night , probably even today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks .
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council does not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our argument , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will take place from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in the former ambience of Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , given a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ cont@@ ested at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the site and already spoke of serious prospects to the house at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly de@@ composed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to grow broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly .
just under one million euros , it counts .
the exterior plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Represent@@ ative sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigations .
the radio station CN@@ N reported that there are already first occur@@ ren@@ ces of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services have accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation should focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took Lup@@ e even more and more in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ tee Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the centre and asked if the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jury will therefore also be called the Indi@@ ct@@ ants .
most of the times , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take under oath .
according to the radio station CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify , said it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp &apos;s advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his head @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the installation show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total fiction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but this usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey has said three times that I will not be determined against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in that , it was said in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June Com@@ ey in front of a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure on account of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Demo@@ crat Sen@@ ators submitted draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg push@@ es in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin solved itself from the shelf .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which is weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometer , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ts .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg , is unclear according to research data .
however , for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual occur@@ ren@@ ces of ice cream in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which has been broken down , has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and interrup@@ ts regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions a few years ago .
a complete shelf @-@ shelf is dis@@ integrated there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C file is in danger , as the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of the shelf and iron does not increase the level of sea level , as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf cause the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before .
this could possibly raise sea level , albeit only to a small degree , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ S@@ ep Hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca after A@@ WI specification with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it stops regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C file shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lag behind the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , in recent decades , however , many ice @-@ sn@@ ags of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees over the last 50 years , counting thus to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks you to come out of the employer association to become more attractive .
only a few days before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been built in administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first day of work .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded for the seats this year .
however , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 jobs in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and human resources development . &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve an apprenticeship campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees leaving the service due to illness or age .
high time to act so that there are no more jobs left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Bog@@ ner , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had a long time already in the chal@@ k @-@ day for a big surprise when he openly questioned the personnel costs and stun@@ ned the other parties .
people want all the possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the local employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should seek a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better to the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees tari@@ ffs for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution legislation .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy wor@@ sens the tone of NGO migrants fle@@ ets
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend retri@@ eved &apos; because their team worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all the charges currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .

the first tour took place on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga matches for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ iters included .
this has also been recognised by the first Bundes@@ liga clubs , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 followed by the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire quite new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train numerous associations will go up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the Gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must , in particular , deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , you could be more often present in these markets online than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia only once a year .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup simulation will be fought .
as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since established themselves where professionals play against each other .
and by 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ elle has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classic sports - for example elevated heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability are needed .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise and pay attention not only to the console , but also to their bodies .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atic sees problems as well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport are missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
this means that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016 , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years sales will be at EUR 130 million .
this is little against the € 2.4 billion of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are already many countries .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports @-@ betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ ó &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer first league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B management board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to glori@@ fy the old times , is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t hold that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy forced to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t betra@@ y the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the recognition that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , when Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter atten@@ ds attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that it should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not imprisonment . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ pen of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain during the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern won a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me right away , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups no Philipp L@@ acher and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made his arm tied to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the stand@@ ings could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ i .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was composed of young musicians , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from holiday homes .
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to enter the inheritance of L@@ üb@@ ner can use a little extra motivation only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ered over the field as a mini @-@ ski@@ pper .
to the right rear , that is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this run@@ e formation like the one who can also take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ op .
he had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
Vi@@ dal consequently to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on devil to get out of the performance of the Asia trip ( also limited only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot .
at least it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , addic@@ ts tried successfully in the game @-@ building a couple of times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw afterwards the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game with Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .

company pleased with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Minister : economics praise W@@ alls Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old minist@@ erial council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Vereinigung Tri@@ erer Unternehmen ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wi@@ sing picks up the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is of course in infrastructure policy : the gap closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning set @-@ up procedure , until 2021 will be the construction law .
the west circum@@ vention of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says secretary spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , of course , it sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label with wine to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been bag@@ ged for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company .
in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros if graduates have become self @-@ employed within ten years of master training .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time it fails to give the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied .
the Chamber of Industry asks for more orders to be assigned to external offices .
CD@@ U faction leader , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than € 20 million in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics at the moment and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared the field due to in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW CEO said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; and thus applied to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dis@@ soci@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could severely affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if it goes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ra @-@ saver .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the opening to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen the worth of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
am@@ ni@@ otic No@@ el N@@ ases and the Lau@@ ghter Against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon dra@@ fts@@ men , the bul@@ bs of his figures are his hall@@ mark .
even at 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , a carto@@ onist for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo had many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , rounded Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to him , he still sits on the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his cute figures continue to find much spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most beloved animal in his drawings - which has a jack of all as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come onto the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced without word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence under threat of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and on account of the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are a lot of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened ones .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ ep@@ unkt &apos; is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ vul@@ sions , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ers , or a landing camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organized crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ as@@ able drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which was the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the list of sal@@ aries of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up all over the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its lack is felt deep , although its presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are seldom tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they are still insi@@ sting on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of dedicated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same history , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues agreed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 USD hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task you need as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who like a harbour worker could curse , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to best do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
tru@@ sting his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells incorrect , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero , and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where employees from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before , it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the governor declared himself un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce has printed three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor to carry out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I Govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man was kidn@@ apped by a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez to be the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few notes and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the Western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ements and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they told the truth .
she has been asked since then to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized by organised crime , government officials and an equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put together organised crime under a blanket .
the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; last year assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern fron@@ tier of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the paper El Nor@@ te writes in the northern limit state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , than at once all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ members and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the ship , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ d@@ fold only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , have probably been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as ret@@ ali@@ ation which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to sof@@ ten its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours discovering it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pir@@ ate behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal as evidence of his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served fla@@ ky skin , but remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal almost looks exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re sho@@ cking a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he &apos;s going to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two feet , perme@@ ated the earth .
although King of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six ton@@ ne heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned in the sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the perpet@@ ual arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the entrance of the house still lay b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ our plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as winning the Lotto .
the more I look at it , the more confusing it will .
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ our plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , mil@@ eage stems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) around 20 people were injured in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age at the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , there were almost 30 vehicles between the connecting offices Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( administrative district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably trucks .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large offer of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel Munich , a roughly ten kilometer long back@@ stage was formed .
as reported as an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also came on the counter @-@ track to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the signs of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : no clu@@ e , one sits in the train and sleeps .
or one is en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the automatic ticket inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you simply confirm by phone that you have taken your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation currently runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway .
you also have to have the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic evaluation will appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train companion arrives at ticket inspection at No@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should take advantage of passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train atten@@ de@@ es checks in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Marketing Executive Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspections belong to the biggest off@@ ences .
because often , however , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents necessary to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or ID or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the trains ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further conc@@ ession numbers on the same route have not yet been un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell in her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police band and people that cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sha@@ kes .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ l@@ dron and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell Form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on eating @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other locals followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team in the years following Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ and &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ and &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story reiter@@ ates the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black gay woman there is so much stake in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the message bodies in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ ci@@ cal links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers talk about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct cle@@ ans the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves the subject cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , from what the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands for , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been selling in the farmer &apos;s market hall almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always very fond of .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can be found in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why buy a shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is unnecessary .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a fair weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , retail stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the mi@@ ds there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad there is almost no special business anymore and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives .
or does the spec@@ tre bit gallery ever manage to sell all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the amaz@@ ingly many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore .
if the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost in@@ conspic@@ uous - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ tu@@ fts and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly tra@@ ded as a secret diplom@@ at on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ former and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and made from the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use were too un@@ equal spectac@@ les that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would make a judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually took only a few days after the book was published , calling Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp has a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things could happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic spl@@ inter@@ ing , the foundation of sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic innovation .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in a hands @-@ free talk of the United States &quot; discipline of discipline such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your words in cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never put the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who h@@ ates from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ eres , which unite as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who will be looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration suggests that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ischen , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been rated and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal procedure investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Levin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Administration of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly calls on susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
security cameras confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of themes , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov posted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA general director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was just never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is taking care to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to target surveys , to offer specialist groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low ad@@ mitting results - so that you can track why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent makes custom @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality - can be identified and addressed quicker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment liti@@ gation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started taking Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
it secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can breed and dem@@ oti@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kot@@ ter International , which has seen companies that have turned too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow your staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gaining feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to better engagement of employees in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customer , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA footage players talk on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle moments are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their gradu@@ ations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center at 6 : 30 am the next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was closed on Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he support the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ id forward , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practices once the camp is terminated , which is due to the clear sight line of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a go@@ at@@ post that will not be an easy task .
bro@@ ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts scrut@@ iny in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ et inspec@@ tors who may be displaying results of the fact exam from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that a test of the new facts testing was started in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a hat@@ ch for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher during the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cosy seat in the Guardian River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan city of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanchol@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &quot; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome mine &quot; ) , it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hydr@@ ates on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape spot@@ ting , gardening , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to take care of the archive , which he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ crats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps depicting what it had : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let all go their course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always paying debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ lady . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his involvement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writers experience
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ kel@@ mä@@ ki , the site of an early 20th century San@@ atorium , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped up in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the announcement of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team for Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honnef people we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the action , it &apos;s all about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is competing with other municipalities .
an average five @-@ digit amount can be paid to the city of Bad Honnef with its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) , advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted put@@ sch attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the prime minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS was thus over .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ aker of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara for this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan called the overthrow test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really get a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ity in Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ g ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the major coach of the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 public servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the military to step up step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives specifically an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer seeking asylum seeking asylum in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ iting from the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for road shuttle bus
over and over again , over the past few months over the future of the braking sh@@ utt@@ les have been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go very fast .
even before the end of the year it is scheduled to be built on the ailing route on which the tourist railway continues .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the route is scheduled to commen@@ ce in the long term to secure the future of the programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Deputy Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he estimated the costs for the repair of the track to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Rail as operators agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle was to be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of a pilot operation in recent months , it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it cannot be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey when publishing his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ anders have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively look .
modern exp@@ anders have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , fre@@ es the most .
on his website true Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origins and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records its increasing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain confusion that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world where there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have sexual ass@@ aults on women .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn bodies and the pic@@ tured eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical likeness to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have an intermedi@@ ary or a background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tru@@ mp big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ce in the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all preten@@ ding to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ im who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with whom she strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dist@@ ressing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y way that one day his pussy wil@@ lows will no longer be thrown out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can norm@@ alizes &quot; the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ ck@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ming music con@@ veys it in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el , however , is still a strange magic experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card to five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to the hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts in his wrist , according to a case in his cell by the prison authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Investig@@ ation Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ bergs schools , the four @-@ bed wat@@ chers from caps and don@@ or ho@@ ops were fired into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
in future three of the students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , the school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the poultry farm but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and he let it brood from his chickens .
instead of a chicken k@@ ens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed ; the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
after that , the classes showed a chicken tan@@ z three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ t@@ eller to feel accepted in his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , former head of the school Michael Müller , who is always involved in teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber @-@ time is now over , school@@ teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years of instruction , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they could rely on the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers .
at the end , all students had a summer and holiday period .
there was great joy in the children .
eight original cas@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camp in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ iting from television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have intensified control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have che@@ que software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the upgrade has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet known a precise date .
Daimler advised to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions go down altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older Diesel so far .
the ACE reveals to wait for sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join the presentation together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would have to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - and even withdraw the funds - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make clear her point of view .
Kennedy &apos;s former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier award winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in the coming year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker City Engineer .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press interview .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application has yet completed the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of dis@@ miss@@ al - there will still be enough time for a re@@ work .
since Has@@ lach acts as a Lower construction law authority for the administrative community , the applicant must instruc@@ t corresponding degrees .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could not fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but city clos@@ eness is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years , a number of significant projects have been carried out , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction department and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz , for example , have started .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stage renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be sm@@ ashed by some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own building yard and gar@@ dener can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection it is important to &quot; have an eye on what it fits , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban construction master emphasizes .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of co @-@ operation in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further shaping of the city .
if you want to be buried under Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to study the town of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or b@@ achel@@ or special@@ ising in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is under construction , civil engineering , structural engineering , basic property planning , municipal property administration , urban farm with building yard and landscap@@ ing , as well as Unter@@ e Bau@@ haus authorities , including historical monuments .
bicycle on lines thrown : South railway track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track routing in the area of the Le@@ oben Stra@@ it ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them for the night hours .
near the crime scene , a motor sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is realm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , were in danger of je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ing themselves and je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ing train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , even the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south @-@ way route could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten people were killed on Friday morning , two of them came to the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help ease IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han would promote more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ l@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also applies to people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan tested a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated from it separately .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of mice had to be done - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were pulled up in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop these types of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with Manchester United signed a &quot; Genie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday night had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ching at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and achieved only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; Pain@@ ting &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no fri@@ ght from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Bund - was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the people from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watched the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with a growing horror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach by head@@ winds .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green cannot reliably go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis .
five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the apo@@ state Lower Saxony chair@@ person El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Green Party to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaign si@@ ghs , as on Friday morning the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD &apos;s Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the transition of the green dep@@ uties to the CD@@ U .
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of great and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades settled down at that time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this became the case - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to its sleeves , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sm@@ ashed the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ pping up again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just kind@@ led new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ es@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the Volkswagen exhau@@ sts and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
the survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed in the context of Martin Schulz as well .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and yet Schulz did not .
for the time being , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected to parliament because of her person , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , &quot; said the Dutch deputy .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Grand@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the German elections to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U dep@@ uties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding Gran@@ t for Center III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the town development on Wednesday met in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been renov@@ ations in sens@@ ations .
at that time , in the re@@ development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April , the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros will come from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s sensi@@ tivities .
how is a renovation project now being created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continues to investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role whether there is interest in the planned territory to be rehabil@@ itated .
if necessary , the territorial borders could also be postpon@@ ed again .
the foot@@ bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal state programme , in which the refurb@@ ishment would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute .
the grants period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey will take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible as possible , so that in the next year it will be possible to start refurb@@ ishment .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann later declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre @-@ tests .
the aim is to assess the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and to decide when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective plot there will be a rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation note in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was an essential success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it is among other things about the structural condition and the renovation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and house &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , gr@@ ind first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , has im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to the medical standard .
the technology is similar to a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on homes and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military data left to the TI@@ ME Magazine by up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the Green @-@ White Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ti@@ cut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House military bure@@ au demanded the presence of the helicopter in frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his boss , the deputy marine commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn event , and until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was vac@@ ated this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the unit &apos;s security personnel remained on the plane during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event might viol@@ ate the destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo op is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp made an inquiry when the presidential jet used his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise interventions in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency Support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the 2017 budget year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for re@@ funds is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp had inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
top Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis B@@ order League ki@@ cks off at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the fact that five games still have a flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained a sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the post@@ erior pole positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the high North are mainly responsible for the class and stability of the S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently active at the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella will not be able to compete in the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) will be the first in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ ly Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also put her back into the team again .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ ers around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ res .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packaged a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels reb@@ elled against the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then investors from the Austrian O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Sou@@ p Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies , are al@@ armed .
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is centered in the hit series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second squ@@ ad@@ ron of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s largest drug trade organization : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dami@@ an Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continues to be cooked out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly laid @-@ boiled refriger@@ ation .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon .
last year &apos;s Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are taken care of 45 days of the week are at noon in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al @-@ time staff are working on the 1st September kitchen service : they heat up the delivered meals , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individual , give away food , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven @-@ group units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chefs now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita premises - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen service also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical one , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are read@@ ju@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with about 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Ha@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to can@@ di@@ fy in the provinces . three women advocate the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ ti@@ lities to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will transfer power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women have registered 3.4 million registered voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 were said to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glasgow
a union would like to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow in Man@@ agers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the manager of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insi@@ sted that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the general site manager concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic process of production , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Plac@@ dis said : &quot; the GM at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the continual engagement with employees and union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ house where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ house location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and complete . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after spending an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record event ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s most paid professional athlete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sted that the club always did its best to take care of him since he arrived from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , they will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Club expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave it under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
in the night of Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally dis@@ car@@ ded a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage of over 200 Euros to the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for hints .
the police witnessed an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ berg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the town hu@@ stle and bustle of Stol@@ zen@@ au a car had to meet him in his lane , so he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
in the car , kind of damage was created .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it can be good that the driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now asks witnesses of the incident and the driver of the cause of the cause to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rati@@ fies Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ t@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication compared to the German press agency , he expected from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence against the dom@@ es is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , according to the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches had been a quite normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of mis@@ use cases , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ o@@ irs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment Professor Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( R@@ atz@@ inger ) was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence exercise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ urch@@ war@@ k and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible when a dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael E@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger actually occurs in it .
only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can , at best , throw it out of it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz Visu@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger receive an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; aff@@ ection@@ ate , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always moved from the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just cr@@ ush chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly and too che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state college .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and abuse of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one is already wondering if it is not to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot of abuse was reported in the report on abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger laid down in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an officer representing the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators for some time .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective cul@@ pri@@ t .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer or more likely to have opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the investigation , that the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run @-@ up to him could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any co @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the adver@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these vile crimes , as it has unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
must he live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge che@@ ek out of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , it is separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Cathedral Treas@@ ure .
the whole aw@@ ful investig@@ ative pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed , and suffered terri@@ bly , were all happening at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he didn &apos;t get the boys first when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but not sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most is the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ astic gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the punishment will continue to be practiced in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already given the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was found , as test sentences were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they were in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows well .
it was difficult for him to assess where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging what is past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right now .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence at innocent children &apos;s sails , that goes far beyond the then ordinary .
this is all terri@@ fying and I am glad that it will finally work up .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly and to draw on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of its Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of the test sentence also come to speech ?
Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , since the dom@@ es played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , un@@ ru@@ ly boys do not make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael E@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something like a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former cats , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ation , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read him , he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him until this day , that he was once severe , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect for respect to which they still look up and which they ad@@ ore .
and please , once again , clearly : everything that was presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that was just released reli@@ eves him .
now it would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
