<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the one-time basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map Munich supports exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork which is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called primeval sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French military leader occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map were there.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Max IV. Joseph further drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian surveying." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "the" "" "Urposition blatt" "" "for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former times / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is the sub-sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the card, i.e. 1877, as Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the city is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: the zooming appears a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "primitive recording" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "there are no more farmers in this area, but small farmers in the plant" "" "Land in Sonne" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810, the scene of the October Festival, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen it is not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or on the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße there were once people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who has been engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place had been, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalcedony plant in Haar (1905).</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich on the premises of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich east is located to the west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the" "" "Casa don Bosco" "" "house - built in architectural resemblance to the original building of the" "" "Irvine" "", "which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombings." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as" "" "Head Place" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombers tore up many holes in the inner city.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel dating back to the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day was the preoccupation and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-american travellers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention on trips through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," stated in the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recent Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities who disproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to release the warning," "" "said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such an abundance that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black motorists are 75 percent more common than whites in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring cowards or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state regarding the number of injuries to the 16th rate of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbach Weidebrn project is a project for success and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary deputies Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU place together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the right-graveyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and housed in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative market for him for the milk of his cows," "" "Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste falls exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "elementary importance."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not profitably manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland provision for a lot of work, much must be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if it did not lead to a biogas plant.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader's support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of the subsidies, farmers are often criticised</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-ment area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">One half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers fence-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "here, best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Growing Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will allow the state support for grazing fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a subsidy outlined by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area that can be fenced off must not be inefficient (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen's Weireluctance Project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area covers 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump opens the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrowing of Saddam Hussein at the company's Plaza in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitations would have smelled him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he picked up its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the stirring sayings of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses, longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical figurative representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great screaming Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the reformed world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective of Miller and Trump ever to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics track, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent on the World Championship will "make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Tom Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped in the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and defer his hairy head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is called official, and of employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful folks who vibrate online the whips.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news reports," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news article" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governor described as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers tackled his leadership.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever more triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of a cancellation, Tesla is paying the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation Form."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 45,000 such non-binding reservations envisage, maused musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Tesla boss, however, does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 is expected - all models will be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently being made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-tested production lines without any major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA leader Pruitt retracts due to the postponement of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he had been accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline which expired on October 1st for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for Ozone Ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Attorney General of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory escalation agenda." ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening Pruitt suggested that its turnaround in ozone standards was simply the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often not adhered to deadlines for execution and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to establish an appointment for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority we give to us." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive introduction of ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 4.30pm on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>

<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle were first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urgent-buch. count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the hill of the hill, apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>

<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlined by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly acquired bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camp near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting-place for the dead from hearing-sweat.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the bell tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>

<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of ground.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four grown households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the furniture fair, once a week I will help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked in the open fullday at the school.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>

<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks of this addition.</seg>

<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus, but gets a real counter-value, which is marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>

<seg id="908">The construction site is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has meanwhile arrived in the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 metre wide bridge is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridgeheads.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular fingertip-feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also an optical cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts on the project.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of Football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can easily make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must act with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their soccer-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, she can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments could come to Neymar about payments made by the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar World Cup will be ambassador and a such maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports published show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to maximize the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling wasn't big enough to place two rooms together, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored on both ends to last longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering was involved," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterproductive, so it is very easy when you push the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing by good design and increased square footage of slightly standard.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an examination of one of the biggest real estate imperialisms of Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and business should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record says that Colin property has a value of $316 million and Paul valued at $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - what Colin claims, as Paul claims to have expelled him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul above to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early monkey painting, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delicatessen transactions dating from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump appointed new Chief of Staff to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House which he wanted to fix: bad information that was put into the hands of the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to convince," "" "said former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February facing Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "at the time, Politico Tara Palmeri wrote that" "" "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy coming out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide a doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with shameful cheques, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone malicious a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson is permanently banished from Twitter because of chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started questioning" "" "Walsh" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump received." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof in the former ambience of Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, given a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not uncontested at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the site and already spoke of serious prospects to the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee has received the work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to people familiar with it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The radio station CNN reported that there are already first occurrences of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services have accused the Kremlin for a long time interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation should focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took Lupe even more and more in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderertee Trump had personally moved to the centre and asked if the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury will therefore also be called the Indictants.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the times, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the radio station CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to testify, said it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his head-in-law Paul Manafort joined the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the installation show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the apprehension for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total fiction," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in that, it was said in the statement.</seg>

<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure on account of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>

<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, which is weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometer, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melts.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual occurrences of ice cream in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The colossus, which has been broken down, has so far been part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and interrupts regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelbow is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf was disturbed by the balance of waxes and abruptions a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shelf-shelf is disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C file is in danger, as the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of the shelf and iron does not increase the level of sea level, as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf cause the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise sea level, albeit only to a small degree, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Sep Horseshoe is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica after AWI specification with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it stops regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists, whether the Larsen-C file shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "" "our models say it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lag behind the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, in recent decades, however, many ice-snags of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees over the last 50 years, counting thus to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks you to come out of the employer association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only a few days before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been built in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously highly sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the seats this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 jobs in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would like to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and human resources development. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and involve an apprenticeship campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns recruit good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "speech is of a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Bogner, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had a long time already in the chalk-day for a big surprise when he openly questioned the personnel costs and stunned the other parties.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better to the employees and officials when it actually foresees tariffs for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new prostitution legislation.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Jugend retrieved' because their team worked effectively with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least such a meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">"" "" "" "under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities." ""</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berliner receipts" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trieste and sights.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga matches for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating through wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaiters included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 followed by the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must, in particular, deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent electric sportsmen under contract, you could be more often present in these markets online than to send the Bundesliga to Asia only once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA World Cup simulation will be fought.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, lilies have long since established themselves where professionals play against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And by 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobelle has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses, which are also found in classic sports - for example elevated heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability are needed.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise and pay attention not only to the console, but also to their bodies.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This means that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany in 2016, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day prior to the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install systems for neutralising the exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dissociating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the study could severely affect Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested, among other things, a cartoonist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo had many fans.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence under threat of climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and on account of the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have developed smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened ones.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and unceasable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the list of salaries of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piling up all over the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and up to now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack is felt deep, although its presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney General was set up in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are seldom tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is still more traitorous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the reason, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of dedicated two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest," if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same history, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues agreed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 USD holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who like a harbour worker could curse, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where employees from Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before, it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the governor declared himself untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For this week's edition, Riodolce has printed three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor to carry out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI Governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was kidnapped by a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as retaliation which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was chased out of sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong pirate behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been of the Cretaceous period," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal as evidence of his life, including his conserved bowel content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved flaky skin, but remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal almost looks exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">"" "you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're shocking a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's going to sleep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two feet, permeated the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonne heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the perpetual armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protrude from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the entrance of the house still lay bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as winning the Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armour plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. '</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) around 20 people were injured in a mass-carambolage at the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell Form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and focused on eating-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell in mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, from what the rest of the business will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands for, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost inconspicuous - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tufts and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly traded as a secret diplomat on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transformer and a pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and made from the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette buttocks and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were too unequal spectacles that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would make a judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually took only a few days after the book was published, calling Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump has a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things could happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to "automatic splintering, the foundation of sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears in a hands-free talk of the United States "discipline of discipline such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they put your words in cold, then they have won," "" "it says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist who hates from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulaceres, which unite as hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who will be looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration suggests that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has gotten a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov posted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to compete with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is taking care to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to target surveys, to offer specialist groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low admitting results - so that you can track why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "as Glint, Convercent makes custom-made" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company finds its employees badly treated or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment or unfair practicality - can be identified and addressed quicker.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started taking Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">It secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the interconnected nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only used.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, disappointments can breed and demotiate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kotter International, which has seen companies that have turned too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gaining feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to better engagement of employees in a branch that is known for high sales.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a hatch for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Guardian River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan city of Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote "Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories" in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just started to take care of the archive, which he referred to as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it cannot be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern expanders have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his finger nails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford-woman progressively look.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern expanders have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one goes one step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, frees the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR records its increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires out of the marginal zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain confusion that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world where there is a president in the White House who boasted to have sexual assaults on women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn bodies and the pictured eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical likeness to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have an intermediary or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truce in the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denim who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship with whom she struggled for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the distressing effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the creepy way that one day his pussy willows will no longer be thrown out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican normalizes "the right wing," which suddenly appears in comparison to his standards as the epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crackling and the animals are twisting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimperming music conveys it in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magic experience, since two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to the hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.</seg>

<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too lenient.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years Wacker City Engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes that no application has yet completed the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of dismissal - there will still be enough time for a rework.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a Lower construction law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must instruct corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could not fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>

<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowllieus, if the same system also applies to people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan tested a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated from it separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbes of mice had to be done - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six species of bacteria were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were pulled up in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and did not develop these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the town development on Wednesday met in sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been renovations in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior, not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On 4 April, the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros will come from the country, the rest of the municipality's sensitivities.</seg>

<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial borders could also be postponed again.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the" "" "Social City" "" "federal state programme, in which the refurbishment would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grants period for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey will take place only once, within the framework of those involved in the refurbishment area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible as possible, so that in the next year it will be possible to start refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann later declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre-tests.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weitder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication compared to the German press agency, he expected from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican's" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised the fact that reporting on violence against the domes is measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "punches had been a quite normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of misuse cases, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoirs" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take George Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Professor Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be said that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims" "" "appreciated" "" "the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories of him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen (Ratzinger) was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a churchwark and perfectionist, who became tangible when a domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Eemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can, at best, throw it out of it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatz Visuasium" "" "on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">This is how the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger receive an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "affectionate," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always moved from the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just crush chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear-cowardly and too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state college.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and abuse of violence at the preschool, these are Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One is already wondering if it is not to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot of abuse was reported in the report on abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger laid down in the final report any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said an officer representing the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators for some time.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective culprit.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was reckoned to him... Buben intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened than against their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "in the course of the investigation, that the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run-up to him could not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the advert." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these vile crimes, as it has unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge cheek out of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Cathedral Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful investigative pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed, and suffered terribly, were all happening at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he didn't get the boys first when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was already discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories of him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most is the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnastic gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the punishment will continue to be practiced in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already given the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was found, as test sentences were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging what is past today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence at innocent children's sails, that goes far beyond the then ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrifying and I am glad that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so ear-cowardly and to draw on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of its Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger played with you in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of the test sentence also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the domes played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not mean that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Weltrang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen. true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, unruly boys do not make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Eemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former cats, 23 years after his emeritiation, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, read him, he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until this day, that he was once severe, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
