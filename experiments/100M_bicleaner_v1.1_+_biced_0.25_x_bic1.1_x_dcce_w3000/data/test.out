a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he never wanted to take part in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be pushed into drawers or glued on from the outside label that usually has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress prefers to spend their time at home , in front of the TV with a cool de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted for the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the horse @-@ riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses .
he left himself with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he never sw@@ ung for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid donated the man from An@@ hausen within a small gala to the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no shortage of awards for the li@@ ke@@ able athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ duc@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he also continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the awards are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the lava price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to prevent this .
however , the two US presidential coun@@ ties are not one of the tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton on the other hand says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject infrastructure .
in the meantime , Tru@@ mp and Clinton have to be inv@@ aded almost elo@@ qu@@ ently .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the government @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so no party discussions could come to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policies are more clearly evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the USA .
oil production is also supposed to be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Change accord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton on the other hand wants to explicitly expand renew@@ ables with her investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only in infrastructure - the two con@@ ten@@ ders are not far from each other even at international trade agreements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ PP , the transp@@ acific trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , however , they do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be better paid , for example , for Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
she wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he should not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop more about the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least from the rich wants to demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost everyday life for women fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby at the maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ over @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has been officially opened recently .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience of sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men are fle@@ eing wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as hop@@ eless ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act , is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , B@@ ahr says .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and badly ab@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what is experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , they need more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is something like this in accommodations of the Govern@@ ments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are housed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women live together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this vulner@@ ability can be read by the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since dealing with that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new labor camp measures
representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have missed the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ SC board today called for a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the assumption that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assists doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he informed BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract was to be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be enforced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ row@@ ly and he didn &apos;t radi@@ ate warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper reported that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing bad had happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the down@@ shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ab@@ u@@ sive .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to cast Russia back on its backs .
the decline was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ y will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything .
at the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from il@@ lic@@ it oil trading in Syria &apos;s territories controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed by almost his office last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dam formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
to this end , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ous one is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is certainly a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of government changes .
the summit meeting in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that have been bre@@ ached and badly treated by the West and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even mastered the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw up the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are speaking at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Board Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the listing of stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customers that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the che@@ ers when he gets the victory at Pre@@ dile@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle races - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern world and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few before him reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a delighted fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already claimed 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already itten the winner in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot , 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties initially when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not in the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin smo@@ kes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it reads that Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as President of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without stating reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has taken Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff stepped down at his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president once upon a time wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated job - one could almost say - to confi@@ de a char@@ geable post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service , K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close @-@ up allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son last month participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement his dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series that follows a team of FBI agents will be published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible any more .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fishes who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that have sp@@ iced out of a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge decks are in place , and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ thinking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the gap existing on the north or the landing page .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue station &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bo@@ e without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ oting engine had an emergency stop , but the boat loos@@ ened from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .

this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig attrac@@ tively priced apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken much more into duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Action Plan Living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : in future , those who want to build on urban areas must assign 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable apartments can also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and must be financed , is intended to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ ptions as possible .
the left wants to achieve even tough@@ est jobs for investors .
not@@ withstanding this , as Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is v@@ ested .
if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to offset the loss of around 1300 favourable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , as the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out @-@ of @-@ date b@@ ind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of taking apartments back into price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
one stroke could solve the problem .
for in the West @-@ city run at the end of the year periods .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back in price binding for affordable apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is again dr@@ astically increased , one removes itself from the objective of the so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of weak social workers in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
teenagers and children no longer go outside but prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand sank in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( via a screen shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped to the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back each day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an Apple Watch app that tra@@ cked up to 35@@ ,000 users , recently told the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people , who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the Wonder@@ ful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air , sunshine and fun .
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y toys that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were already able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to sport how it does this game .
the new will lose its all@@ ure and the use will fade with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in the women &apos;s competition
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climbed the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team winner A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual competition of women in the arts gymn@@ asti@@ cs at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and in total the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on said she &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Tournam@@ ent at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long pathway , it is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ a slightly led through two turns , the picture sm@@ elled .
suspended beams and dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and on the ground a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into Bil@@ hah &apos;s bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a margin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in Phoenix &apos;s first mass murder , while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in h@@ is@@ panic barracks within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and that it was assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the aid of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund neither could sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age , and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can walk with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the sign language Ed@@ mund mentioned for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund merely invented some signs .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . there will be more rainf@@ alls on Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have claimed tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stream @-@ downward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams pushed people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , asc@@ ended strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been much more balanced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a minor subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were in@@ und@@ ated .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for residents to participate , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison County said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police told that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the lum@@ bar , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was enriched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores told the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared with the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several guns .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ saw the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a lasting struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the road , there were tubes .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters involved , who were very active , &quot; told Police Head@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia on the radio station .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and police reviewed the surveillance video at the time .
on Tuesday another six @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cr@@ us@@ her on her arm when she played in front of her house in West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in gymn@@ asti@@ cs and for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asti@@ cs , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is a catho@@ lic church , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ thematic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so turn classes in the whole country do not look out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ners in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ asti@@ cs are an expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ astic clubs , which are maintained by parents for training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their trainers and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asti@@ cs are in wealthy suburbs who can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts provide their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ asti@@ cs .
we must au@@ n the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy accessible gymn@@ asti@@ cs training .
I founded my gymn@@ astic foundation for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asti@@ cs in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asti@@ cs that make the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ asti@@ cs develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in elections rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend contributions to improve the care at home times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee of Assistance Centers , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have still considered serious concerns about the proposed Treaty , in particular that it will stimulate the current workforce crisis and it will be given to meet all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes with the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover physicians on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ salary for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance doctors to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nursing staff and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the committee of assistance physicians and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive involvement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training camps and the gender specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can lower heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication once advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffers a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , the pads form .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the N@@ ICE approach , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the person &apos;s quality of life .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally acc@@ esses the police , election monitors and town halls to have ignored election abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must name just his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable inks to a person &apos;s finger when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only to fight electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government against the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have guided his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud all over the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading out expressions to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions should have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate let@@ ter@@ heads to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your passport .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter of letters .
prohibition that political activists deal full postal elections and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers for election stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law , facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the &quot; Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 &quot; ( The People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone into the electoral box .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was put .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ tive registr@@ ations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are advised this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot beyond the border and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ do@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year old Olympics is by far not the only athlete that has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
except K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the racing track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ celeb@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I suppose it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Britain &apos;s Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big expressive eyes , should be able to go through to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
a further persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal te@@ em@@ aker Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to fans to resemble an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial expression and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter User@@ group explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial expression and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons encomp@@ assed Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like &quot; low off &quot; and &quot; a pig died &quot; during the race .
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle Parade .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor reed , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators all over Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lanes T@@ we@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capit@@ ulate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai @-@ Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , at which many were talking to him
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end for more than 90 times among the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our folklore media in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to her as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ respect was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own gar@@ den@@ trousers and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to appe@@ ase and went out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother her that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home pants that had another person and that were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the pieces of clothing from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and she wasn &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question have been sold for sale .
how to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a club in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind you will show you this video how you turn the sk@@ ewer over for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one approaches you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the knee into the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s done to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to deliver your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller underwent a serious test by his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex , taking off some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink in a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the we@@ aning of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get into .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was in@@ filtr@@ ated under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of le@@ aning the sli@@ t button of a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink , there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily , nothing left what he le@@ aned more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely among a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which he refused to lick after her L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst that I have o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ iny than that !
I won &apos;t lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social home after a dele@@ tion with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irre@@ parable condition .
the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had attached was street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish has been found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn open
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing forced her and her partner forci@@ bly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ eting were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally away , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall housing , said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a dele@@ tion is always the last step to take into account Corn@@ wall housing .
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ eting on the ground
workers of the house management will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after she ple@@ aded guilty to the owner of a class B Dro@@ ge .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house &apos;s walls were gra@@ ffiti covered .
the police say they will act as tenants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police told that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ al was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without blame , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pl@@ ung@@ ed after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal watched the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force placed an incredible crash
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was prev@@ ent@@ able .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a public jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage shows how the military plane flew almost in tangible near@@ ness over the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ entri@@ eb@@ werke without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and thereby forced to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew lower than usual due to bad visibility due to bad visibility , but the air force forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits its visibility .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
as a result , the World Ranking List won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made themselves the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone at the record alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they pulled themselves back onto the grand@@ stand and left their favor@@ ites on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches to this point for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said lo@@ gically .
after the game posed gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight only in the first movement with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he set the tempo at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma was not the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ kun@@ ani won the Bronze Med@@ al against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ pping injury , after that he was in medical treatment and had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , were in similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has announced the weaknesses of his campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment when the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media clas@@ ps .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tru@@ mp and his assistant from the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equally impressed .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
both Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not do anything other than telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tru@@ mp has threatened to strike funds to support its campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey results .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ can candidates for Congress would be stronger under the arms .
Olympia : three Sc@@ am Sc@@ am in the dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics .
after a sc@@ aling attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer back home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ seller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team leadership Kenya from dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , given an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate the assessment , &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , gave the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as head of mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was World Cup @-@ fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time in the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing compounds .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks presented by IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type , surface @-@ covering and systematically atten@@ u@@ ated .
Russian athletes then were expelled from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary in a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
in this staging , Bart@@ oli is playing an older Mary .
she recalls with sad@@ ness her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
she is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ cc@@ inos have gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers do not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever meeting this decision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell has the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked with Clinton to nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was not suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and for Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats Magazin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us earlier this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys is different since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community calcul@@ ates with mass flight
&quot; those who don &apos;t suit themselves and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ ds in Germany reck@@ ons on a short term with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the attempted coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions before months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the tel@@ e@@ ated put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even assimil@@ ates refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vice @-@ president compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit @-@ pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks into foreign countries .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand @-@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t suit themselves and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alists and Sa@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Handel Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum bene@@ fici@@ aries recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and almost 29 percent of all recognised as asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey is not the result of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as up to now , it &apos;s not about summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that &apos;s what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not have to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end votes , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in the p@@ olls .
excit@@ ingly , how strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition @-@ day remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a bit with the people , just as his legendary ancest@@ or Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Seel@@ er has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Angela gives the blame for the thri@@ ving of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the most beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes an election campaign in the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the North @-@ East @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual electoral campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you are br@@ ushing away the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire for people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign fight .
in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ gging behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and put up their electoral campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president , Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on a search for traces of native vocal ch@@ arities among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is renovated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end at about 20 a.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
the remuneration of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for instance when it comes to the establishment of administrative procedures .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg gives rise , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fan@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the escape route through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some considerable dis@@ comforts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ mann@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many roads were seeking and more familiar with their navigation system than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ced .
since the speed limits were not met , the congregation was demanding ampli@@ fied the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself clear on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been lash@@ ed .
the fastest time was 77 hours per hour in the speed 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led them to break@@ through@@ s makes everyone you ask to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the renovation of the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation with which note replied , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it &apos;s also somewhere else .
that his pedi@@ gree cuts back after the end of the renovation work , there is no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that its host has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are being scre@@ ened .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ vers@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they over@@ challenge no one .
other progressive points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was located at the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time to hide before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is equally not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD until now : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that has no chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they sometimes have it in themselves : he is planning a quick method for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and open social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to face some even worse than previously - such as comm@@ itting crimes or intentionally throwing their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
some have also left un@@ checked and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people deeply devoted were not to be clas@@ sed at times of election .
the inner safety has shifted tremend@@ ously into the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking position in the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , between the two parties it was high .
only a short quar@@ rel over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy idea @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the department leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also lab@@ ori@@ ously lab@@ ori@@ ously lab@@ ori@@ ously tones .
he has nothing of a return from the double passport .
we have paci@@ fied the discussion in Germany .
to make you new , do not make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there &apos;s a lot of things that could cause trouble .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profile internal security on the subject of internal security .
party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals the willingness to talk and say : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still off lightly .
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it is not going round in all markets .
in the recall action there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term .
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel boom , Europe &apos;s biggest car shower can continue to boast a plus , despite the diesel prices , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand became weaker , especially in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year level .
deliveries were sack@@ ed by almost a sixth in the home market Germany .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially back to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the main affected landmark of the Lower Saxony is further problemati@@ sed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is to be found .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler further showed a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated waste gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen confirmed that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car park provides the customer with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after the conversion , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen allowed its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transportation , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA fully . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that during fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , deterior@@ ations will take place after the conversion and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , for example half a year after the conversion , customers could come to a workshop for example with a motor vehicle - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there may be uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sent@@ encing from rich savers in future as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief Executive Officer Joseph Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund demands from private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros for checking or day @-@ of @-@ day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been jumping 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cost 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now shares the costs according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards , or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from 3 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele , which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she is paying for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other bank known to charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to the negative is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to compete .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men of middle age love plates .
before you rush to the commentary piece to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ ation Men &apos;s Middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ G@@ v , the much discussed recovery of vinyl records is not caused by a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who bought a plate recently , are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer .
it is also not hor@@ des by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffy before I stop , keep my hands and say something special to me like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly loses its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate special shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of discs : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than to buy and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and enjoy spending time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have caused them to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of supporters of the record of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some of the record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar mu@@ ff@@ lers , of objects that wake up happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ats from a panel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I plan@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP to put it into a shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost an entire floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged adults .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sex @-@ packed pop , instead of experimental jazz , gro@@ ans from loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach if you stand by someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the s@@ labs for sale .
it &apos;s more a window @-@ window than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t earn much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I preten@@ ded to dis@@ courage the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries like plates .
even though my research has shown that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , at least in disk stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record shops and online forums do not take into account .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning security with bum@@ ble@@ bees through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they steer clear of the star@@ ring view of an un@@ cann@@ y 30 year false present@@ er who ra@@ ges over the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting men of middle age .

French court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French tribunal has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to break up 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people conducting the 72 provisional shops but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the Nieder@@ reis@@ sen was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally served and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympics disappointed : Martin remains champion
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the Olympic time , cycl@@ ist Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; I keep watching the World Cup , remain confident and keep fighting , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly said it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s timing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace , what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time @-@ flying World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three times champion World Champion , who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how much money flows for the take @-@ over , Microsoft did not share with it on Thursday .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players aband@@ on@@ ment and oppose enemies as well as provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed gauge : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ ters are being tested , which are supposed to transfer templates particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic enforcement bodies of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary temporary polish , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary gl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit@@ ations@@ as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans of time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state , the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer by car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also nut @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are bl@@ aming with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fiji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , back , line and raw power to win gold - its first olymp@@ ic da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fiji had beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in its best form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but probably it won &apos;t be - at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji had a wonderful start and the attacks poured G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one were running into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au spotted in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji .
in seventh minute V@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the kick @-@ off and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u ra@@ ced through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB is still being taught .
this is how it is .
GB performed basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ vian void ... for whole four minutes , what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play from Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt at GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ elled and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ un@@ ched into the grass .
in the previous day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown led the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no more em@@ otic gold than in these games , and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they prevented the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 un@@ varn@@ ished commitment , which is also unparalleled .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al movement .
behind every gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and there was no more hind@@ ran@@ ce than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right word in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t get lost during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go outside and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ tes @-@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the staff for 31 years , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency procedures on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation for farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the new purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renew@@ als of water pipes .
there has been no down@@ time and you have always resum@@ ed new innovations because water feeds life and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dat@@ ory , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and has lived the water @-@ purpose association virtually as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to cut nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful boy@@ friend .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the structure of the well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
but the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest effort was the rup@@ ture at the hop@@ per at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of new brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly talks to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and addresses other concerned parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but now , eight years ago , Ti@@ ago has been well forward and is now studying in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which is two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; Net@@ reb@@ ko said .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him is publicly punished .
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ ze .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man carries a bald .
the man should not be directly addressed .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck intended not to provide any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ gang or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special task force ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens , which threatened the industry from the extraction of green electricity , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Um@@ br@@ ation in the existing systems for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ current production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry provided additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators can be replaced in the steel works have an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this will not be lifted up in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
in this way the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission allow@@ ances , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers pushed China into the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have an effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have emerged .
it is unclear how sustainable the price @-@ collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been stagn@@ ating again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced crowd went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt he took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors right from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , writes H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist .
through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs awak@@ ens many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia care for long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone exercise so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby doesn &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz suggests .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can simply join in .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
whoever wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive than han@@ go@@ vers on k@@ itt@@ ens of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect has the reputation of cat babies on adult animals .
to her surprise , the Mi@@ xed also did not leave the males cold - however , they always kept the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to leaves of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary High School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not significant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens were different with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ te of babies who were taken out of the whel@@ ping box for three minutes and were separated from mother and brothers .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who have not had any offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned out more quickly to the loudspeaker when the rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have ever responded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : business as usual is announced .
even when the state of emergency was suspended after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government failed to im@@ pe@@ de the everyday life of normal citizens .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it does not stop even in front of the football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
accordingly , the Sü@@ kis@@ r living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency first lasts for 90 days still until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks but as good as no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan at the end of Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will be especially true for Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne Cathedral proved its sporty value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Pre @-@ Evo @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; will be competing early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it just reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who scored the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal winners as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cker @-@ King .
this is also the reason why the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract at AC Florence , had announced an ex@@ iled Gom@@ ez after the attempted coup attempt , not to return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in order to do so , the storm would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of its estimated annual salary to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin was already blocked twice because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ting athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the subject of dop@@ ing is still subject to the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock compla@@ ined her starting right shortly before the Games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly ki@@ cked out and lined up at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scenario : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she noticed that she was not going to fetch gold , the audience burst into a jam @-@ storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start of the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest challen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six @-@ month lock after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested in 2013 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 in a positive way to the banned stimul@@ ant drug of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ in@@ ee and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ i@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ ette .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion at over 400 m , was positive tested in 2010 and 21 months were blocked .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , rep@@ ented Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 year old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had been recognized as many med@@ als later .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ings and the 2006 European title because of testosterone mis@@ use .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and the gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but can still be started in Rio .
in the 29 year old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement has been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and was running on 13 July .
bomb terr@@ ors in Thailand - Austrian inj@@ uri@@ ous - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her return trip at the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further person was killed by the authorities .
a bomb det@@ on@@ ation was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with holi@@ day@@ makers , was viol@@ ated by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone to the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier .
finally det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ eastern coast called for several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express oneself with possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist revolt movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs sent by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities would have received secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in the past days - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group lies behind the attacks .
the police proved their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always some minor bomb attacks , but usually they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thai king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai Security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applied to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives great influence to the military in the coming years as well .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country turned towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , will be able to bring the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insur@@ gent uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody plot of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the basic democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ier of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are in extrem@@ ist manner diff@@ used .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multination@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority was closely coordinated with the officials in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of the constitutional complaint possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change its direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation , Ma@@ ï@@ d said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have established in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee protests , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be recognized .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ xi@@ ate expressed that many acc@@ esses went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum lod@@ gings have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who have then ra@@ dic@@ alized themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its Bec@@ omes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ asit was subsequently promoted to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first run of 48 seconds and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more well @-@ known in under@@ represented countries .
as most athletes run in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ asit simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity ban &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
memorable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a preliminary race over 100 meters Fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the Neue Platz has been stolen .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der@@ in on Monday left her business on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she returned from 8.@@ 15 am the next morning , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash desk .

video surveillance is also not available .

if Donald Tru@@ mp loses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance formed .
mail goes into trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric @-@ delivery vehicle from the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon want to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to sell to third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their own developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des said there are always questions , about arti@@ sans .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and make a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in late July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .

GF@@ RP @-@ leadership dec@@ lines after dis@@ ap@@ pointing annual figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts were suddenly coming - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uns@@ ec@@ ured the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing annual figures and the resignation of the company management , the global number five in the industry faces a new beginning .
G@@ RP executive chef plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management in the Executive Board already over@@ took the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1 , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann has been found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the cuts , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will be the market research company in future will be still unclear .
in investor circles it was on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the re@@ organisation initiated years ago was enormous .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not be able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the profit in the second quarter mainly affected the s@@ unken value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s corporate value sales of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , secured a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the line .
the Gf@@ K had generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into a cro@@ ok in tren@@ ches : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel agency from Eisen@@ ach , according to his specification , had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck which was partly on the counter @-@ track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade freed the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the in@@ conclu@@ sive travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the town of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to contact the police .
the charges per cubic meter of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Germany from October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a slu@@ gg@@ ish calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , foundations were established for these sewage installations .
due to legal bases , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ covering manner .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh@@ ochschule , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out the body , a new calculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will be compensated .
the serious increase in fees resulted in the fact that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low drainage capacity , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for instance , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have grave consequences .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the back of the calculation period , all three facilities were not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair costs in a substantial scale .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for world food , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ank , the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the pond sewage treatment Lop@@ p , after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was to be installed in order to meet the requirements of water law in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of the small waste water incident in the three facilities , expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entre@@ tei@@ ment costs , remained spar@@ ed in the sewage installations over the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long term , as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater treatment association will not be able to expand these facilities , because these facilities are defic@@ its .
Bulgaria marks for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , compared to positive 0.2 % .
the annual average annual rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 there was a rise in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell on clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained unchanged as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it &apos;s in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps will come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have reviewed critics in the past , in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and che@@ ered che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow spotted . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others voted against the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and the least , was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face has been pulled into the ab@@ ject extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural heritage wire .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counter@@ parts - could expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters generates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said K@@ atie Z@@ hu , 25 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the sett@@ ling practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that largely ignored Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel responsible , focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in their turn , Z@@ hu said that she will have her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership mis@@ ses IS@@ IS intelligence services , establishes the Committee of the Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the armed forces committees , secret service committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly posted a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on @-@ site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that governments under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from mid @-@ 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Central Command heads changed intelligence reports to reduce the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense .
the democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensated the morality of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was moder@@ ately little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Chief In@@ spec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions with regard to the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the mine information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the pressures of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupying force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s chief commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature due to its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , this is what they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place in their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man out of the way the other group starts .
as always the game starts on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and for the first time with three years she had a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to make things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work set in London that we now have .
we have been able to completely s@@ nat@@ ch the helm .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the first half of the game with a kno@@ ck out of the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory , but the team was surprisingly tough and maintained the range from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the goal to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously reserved a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amidst the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame is not the same every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not generally accepted : aerial shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ ingly noticed in the last 16 years that many of those I inter@@ viewed didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a gro@@ unded enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asti@@ cs and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jumping on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and salt ) before landing on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , you will be rated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also another sne@@ e@@ zing finish in the television transmission : the world or the olymp@@ ic record .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I myself feel ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the trampoline v@@ ector is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly up again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and engagement will be staged on Friday after@@ no@@ ons , at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time streaming ; the men on Saturday , also 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of a mid @-@ afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 onwards .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male American tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base according to the air .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia reached the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen protests were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and spread to more and more regions .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen fired and killed officers in tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , Project Manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terror over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expands at a considerable pace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , although dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth are prot@@ esting .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which have been forced more or less in recent years , will benefit from the turbul@@ ence and arming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are now explo@@ ding after years of sali@@ vation under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians pointed out that they were so invited to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land regions .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is inher@@ ently dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , served as prime minister to Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in seeing early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take over the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many are concerned that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , evi@@ den@@ ced by the analysts , apparently by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months , and this period of un@@ rest was over relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for air@@ planes over the neighbouring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who are trying to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining what he did not mean at all .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp with@@ drew in regard to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last whi@@ rl@@ wind of criticism falls down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling cargo values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton made speeches about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I meant sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then reverse them as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated sound as its cargo values have gone back .
a new pol@@ l from N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humour .
but as he stands in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was asked about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s correctness that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ banks , completely wrong , and so it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing them to get aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being around in each of his words and preten@@ ding to be prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , peasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
crowded at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a kid @-@ friendly café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were disp@@ elled .
So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which sold out in the summer of 2014 , is selling soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals drunk it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered to provide funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cked onions .
there are natural tears .
café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also replaced by pricing from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the club .
even after drawing to Green@@ point she would take the path .
when the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not realize a gru@@ dge that the soap business had occupied the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice local would like to put the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a return home .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt has been passionate about Fi@@ fth Avenue for refined delicacies such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ ke &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; deals with Chinese cuisine in the USA while bri@@ ck@@ work in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ef@@ ree snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix .
when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ fry , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the way the country was going to no longer be the land of shame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new diet was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods to recy@@ cle the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful species , food residue , &quot; as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends were tried as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction took preced@@ ence over taste or even wholes@@ ome cooking .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge to turn pamp@@ er like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ eating attitude .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million@@ fold man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully un@@ realistic .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to cancel an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the host of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food handling , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , told Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after the plates were disp@@ at@@ ched at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the recipe recipe given by President Roosevelt for lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common trick to give a modest recipe to modest recipes .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each th@@ aw@@ ed something un@@ willingly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E got a supplement three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can Do @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ster , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the ground to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at stake in order to draw people from bom@@ bed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Ci@@ vi@@ lian Prot@@ ector , showing him a 11 hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the image , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic till today .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour , it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it arrives it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
the Evol@@ ution@@ ist bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland sh@@ arks will become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their slow @-@ motion , to some extent , when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which f@@ ishers from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons testing larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , on the other hand , contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons trials , so in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday .
all major Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ l core , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could be even 3@@ 92 years old .
the fact that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals was at the threshold of sexually mature with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers and its age was established at 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the reproduction obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland expedition , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the other hand , rather invest its resources into a long life .
construction site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues related to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the release of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently shown residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ fication and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying were clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ der@@ straße &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Imple@@ mentation section 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the municipality is convinced that the rural areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , bau@@ bles can now announce themselves in the City Hall , the Municipal Council is expected to discuss the awar@@ ding of the plots in its September session .
in order to be able to meet even requests for sett@@ ling further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n area , the trade area already shown there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
on the other hand , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
so far , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are using large US banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying union &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk scheme ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg indeed conce@@ als a large fund business , but also worse in terms of infrastructure in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the River Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 in Frankfurt .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which rose in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jur@@ ation and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was raised on Thursday , U.S. National judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and took property on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j of the Islamic State again
troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) comb through the city at the moment following the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians detained by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ CS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under perfect control now , but we just run clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earnings of 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech hon@@ ors ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax statements over the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and withdraw@@ s regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote clin@@ ton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not complete .
among other things , Tru@@ mp Cri@@ tic , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business angels and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp en@@ forces his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ er@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tru@@ mp has a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax test of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax return revealed that it was only USD 100 of its income as a wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent , four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the International Phone Day , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the light of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the li@@ ili@@ ate mixed with soil is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a gold @-@ dre@@ aded fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , light explosion .

the city council now rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ki@@ osk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Baltic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine bank this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab guests were &quot; challenged &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel at the hotel selection list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ oked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels management &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind that stood still more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the representative of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in exactly this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ forest@@ ation of Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel into the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the recommendation of the governor of São Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters were seen gra@@ ffiti against the provisional president Michel Tim@@ er on walls .
the latest protests happened a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , divided the ambass@@ adors .
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trading expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by supplying machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representative issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
searched for : beverage Market covered in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled from the gravel parking space situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in direction B 256 ( schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the attack ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) must urgently report to the police in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer break
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social @-@ pedago@@ gic daily group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers on their summer break in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quietly situated Lei@@ sure theim , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of the school .
several full @-@ day trips were on the programme .
on the one hand we went to B@@ save with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the yach@@ ting unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were taken together .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Upper Mini@@ stries of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the Freiburg cathedral to celebrate the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms went their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ my sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and told the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was tra@@ ded .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is stopped at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially produced pilgri@@ m song .
par@@ son@@ ances of the local parish were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and fir@@ mer dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to first desc@@ ended around 500 metres altitude at a low temperature and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks here .
in the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage goal was welcomed by co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold was won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ er made the legend hau@@ ghty , when he stor@@ med home for a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in due time as Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who prevailed with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner placed an olymp@@ ic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was slightly back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an olymp@@ ic board in the final round and the World Champion was defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der pointed out that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
the form of Kenn@@ y is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will be focused on safety .
he had cont@@ ested yesterday with officers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and will be finished tomorrow , Laura def@@ ected , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played drama in the background , as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April was set in the midst of sex and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ u , as well as the retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy agreement
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator res@@ ig@@ ns the energy supply contract so that all supply contracts are suspended , as the supplying energy company communic@@ ates .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy fixed for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the press line of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminum melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , said that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L earnings from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not imp@@ inge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &quot; testim@@ oni@@ als at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually uses some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to generate about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this coin brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ ans similar ? ) , descri@@ p@@ tive reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow take part in this publicity .
with a view to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her with the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold out edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a volume similar to an image tape than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertisement on the 8@@ 32 pages of the em@@ bank@@ ment ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all about Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
certainly J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called them &quot; The Mi@@ st@@ as of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the ver@@ mouth seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of her on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she &apos;s in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres annually assign 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief agencies are re@@ buff@@ ed annually by the community centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further indirect cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy labour@@ ers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already operating over@@ ly , are prepared for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of community centers found that thousands of people have already been refused each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without the government &apos;s resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the German government will cut its resources by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of aid from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Justi@@ ces and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their community communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of re@@ port@@ edly pulling gun
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp Campa@@ ign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after her being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February directed a fire@@ arm to an employee while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i announced to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the course in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee hall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment was to take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge was to appoint judge .
Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not be offen@@ ded by violence .
B@@ ord@@ is complaint requests compensation from the campaign to breach the duty of care and of Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip did not fail .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ord@@ i v. Donald J. Tru@@ mp For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could further rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both states and would have had good chances to remain the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would drop to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still lag behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory used to be eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business 20 years ago , 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age .
20 years ago , however , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; computer fair as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit tor@@ menting slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the prize was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euro .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could sense in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; cell phone thri@@ ll experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today is dominated by suppliers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment will be around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , easy to operate with touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , and today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today , every German is looking at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of personnel in the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ vers , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities we will already employ 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ Shift is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ minded people were wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in natural growth and leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the whole of GB .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the same . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lock@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements in order to make it more difficult to detect indicating that which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sign@@ ers have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year between Pa@@ stor@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue .
the company apart from ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs has a large amount of revenues , so Facebook is worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that adding new filters would wor@@ sen new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , so we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over the hands of people .
woman committed suicide on Swiss auto@@ bahn
the victim was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning had passed on a highway during a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 would have tried to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck .
she still passed away on the ground .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said , asking these and any witnesses of the incident to sign up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the free@@ way - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian prec@@ e@@ des in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after killing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ro@@ de in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ gy atmosphere and slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also prof@@ ited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus increases its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers .
although it was supposedly inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billions years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escaped with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needed and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers are taking discussions again , put on strike &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labor disputes relating to wages for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start early next year to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its contra@@ ctions in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ union with the British utility BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation escal@@ ating through the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the cluster &apos;s cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ade .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates in the star @-@ pile and in what connection are the rotation @-@ periods with the planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the quick@@ est ones .
at peak rot@@ ations , these ri@@ pping stars cast large quantities of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ ps , its rotation @-@ rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges from
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base zu Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will bear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been selling 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but in the rest hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 Ster@@ oids banned .
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a development in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have been receiving performance @-@ promoting agents in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favour for 2014 because I played a 20 year without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days don &apos;t run no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends have survived the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and re@@ affir@@ med the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was symp@@ athetic to the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a well @-@ known athlete would have won almost a medal .
the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro have been announced before the seventh competition day .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to an unknown .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon local time , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m of Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing has been requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua out of a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer IO@@ C but CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the forbidden substance is about the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class until 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the Kenya nation produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the former tre@@ ads in China also ensured clas@@ hes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to pass it over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio .
sun was also the focus of an examination with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively by the Chinese championships in 2014 for the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
programmers from Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 5@@ 40 companies in North America , United Kingdom and Germany , 40 percent of respon@@ dents in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially ex@@ tor@@ ted ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a horri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most paint programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered the black@@ mail software .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was made horri@@ bly fast over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported turnover losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals had already been victims of attacks whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you only fund the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers examined the use areas and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or de@@ code for free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual ex@@ tor@@ ters .
the latest malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware themselves , counsel@@ ing , and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; it comes complete with a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the ex@@ tor@@ ters then are looking for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per machine .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on preventing ran@@ som@@ ware from using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not sufficient for successful assessment , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to release sensitive data such as lists of lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
the cul@@ pr@@ its could also completely take on new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators are blocking a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cockpit top drops something .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the Peugeot 2008 comparable .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should make his work somewhat qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline unit with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( operates at speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long @-@ distance assistant works very reliably .
and the smart temperature regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI bus@@ hing are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Du@@ essel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when the organizers pay
after their journey , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the illness is to be found in the hotel without a doubt .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests demonstrate the same symptoms .
in the case of the negotiated case , a family on the second day of their door was severely damaged by diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a faulty sewage treatment plant which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined to the organisers .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he therefore did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment .
no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion to one another - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence done by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to react to terrorism .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders have to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and strength also the consent of the people for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a transp@@ osition of the proposals to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another human reinforcement of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four scale order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weap@@ onry is so amended that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is made difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to seek solutions , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid what you reject , and I oppose wearing the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules , for example , in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wants to simulate crime and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it is regularly st@@ owed on the stra@@ its - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal regulation is to be extended .
this is a good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the environmental road every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße , the state @-@ owned road construction extends the right @-@ hand bending road by 700 meters .
drivers can then come directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic is spl@@ itting early , which improves the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district representative Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder drives drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
half the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ ta@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is only drawn on a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ laimed before a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load @-@ carrying capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected daily traffic jam will continue , the local government cannot say .
however , with years to come , the bridge has an official remaining service life by the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal regulation , the state company deliberately chose the most convenient time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : culture offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Wald@@ schule has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students visited the small house between 11 and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most adolescents of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ swing , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a musical theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December young people with and without refugee and migration background have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has taken the Star Tre@@ k Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany on night to Friday for a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ des , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep far from the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not restor@@ ative .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes can be under@@ mined , emphas@@ ised Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you mean for the time being below , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an entry and go @-@ through disorder .
it is precisely the passage of sleep that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board of the German household doctor association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fle@@ mming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie down badly , wake up every two or three hours and possibly start p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , gives birth to an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems go to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical strokes only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any sleeping physician in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what will happen ?
for an examination in sleep laboratory doctors , for example , with snor@@ ing with breathing agents , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a transit distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cal@@ ming , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera shows the sleeping room at the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a number of adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ Be counts on : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch television for sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to have
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler posted a dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time placed his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler protected himself via Facebook in front of his former te@@ amm@@ ate colleagues .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in swimming @-@ sports is bad , the dop@@ ing controls however are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be kept with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ ggage Se@@ ats arrested
professional screens at Düsseldorf Airport
civilian victims of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 @-@ 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage @-@ ste@@ els as ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the police from previous theft delicacies .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in a joint , labour @-@ friendly and especially professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ ar 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who had come to Germany specifically to commit criminal off@@ ences .
at the same time , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 euro .
the Rig@@ aer Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain appears at first sight not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one gets past play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain calls , are , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin @-@ based interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , the police pat@@ rol for three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of houses in the sun , others talk about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ wing force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , are mostly gener@@ v@@ ated by the police presence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concerns of rising mi@@ stress and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wishes to make a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police arise between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbours , does not appear so clearly .
Friedrichs@@ hain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today has a low average income and high poverty rate compared with the rest of the city .
in 1990 a number of houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the R@@ ī@@ ga River .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and scri@@ b@@ bers from all over the world : with them residents of GDR times and former house occup@@ ations share their neighbourhood .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were tos@@ sed with coloured bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes involve damages which tend to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a ten@@ ancy house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is very important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Riga city anymore .
for the architect , architect , her street is not a criminal , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved into Riga &apos;s street - and stayed .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that the old residents are pushing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people - there are more people who don &apos;t feel so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I cannot appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
for people who are anno@@ yed with color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from , should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district , can complain about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , Working Group Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else interfer@@ ing with .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the icy Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
for example , some - less mo@@ cking rather than on the multitude of desired tasks intended - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organizing , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding issues .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private dwell@@ ings .
so far , it is not possible to work for private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be rec@@ tified , as it is called beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments has it not been done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
besides a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need deals like sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it is just and they can make sense to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
whoever builds the feeling at any time , he cannot help in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work , and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the latest happ@@ enings , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also a topic among the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ vo@@ cable .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , main and honorary officials have to look out for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new sto@@ ke of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question is to be answered clearly , the politics atro@@ phy .
actually it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the old people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
