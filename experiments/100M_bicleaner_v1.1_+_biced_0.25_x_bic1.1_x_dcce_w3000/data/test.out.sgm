<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted for the feed-troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="9">And with that the horse-riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left himself with his family over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he never swung for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid donated the man from Anhausen within a small gala to the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of awards for the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adduced him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been supporting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the awards are the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giengen, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump want to prevent this.</seg>

<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the meantime, Trump and Clinton have to be invaded almost eloquently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the government-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policies are more clearly evident." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "" "" "but not only in infrastructure - the two contenders are not far from each other even at international trade agreements." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>

<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop more about the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors have called on their union to approve new labour campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have missed the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly and he didn't radiate warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downshot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was abusive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to cast Russia back on its backs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousy will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illicit oil trading in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed by almost his office last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedam formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistent resentment on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pious one is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is certainly a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of government changes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "Alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that have been breached and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn't even mastered the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw up the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are speaking at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin smokes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of Putin's tightest confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, it reads that Putin has ordered" "" "dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as President of the Russian Presidential Administration without stating reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff stepped down at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president once upon a time wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated job - one could almost say - to confide a chargeable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close-up allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first seal represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-thinking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the gap existing on the north or the landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens say:" "" "investors should be taken much more into duty in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "Action Plan Living" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD vice-president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we agree with the Greens: in future, those who want to build on urban areas must assign 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favourable apartments can also arise in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the town hall is," "" "said Bratmann:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and must be financed, is intended to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann said:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions right now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to achieve even toughest jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding this, as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is vested.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to offset the loss of around 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, as the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out-of-date bindings from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of taking apartments back into price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">One stroke could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West-city run at the end of the year periods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there back in price binding for affordable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they don't want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one removes itself from the objective of the so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of weak social workers in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke comments:" "" "for a vast majority the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and children no longer go outside but prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand sank in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found," "" "photographed" "" "(via a screen shot on the mobile phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped to the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracked up to 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the Wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air, sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy toys that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were already able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to sport how it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its allure and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On a whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team winner Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the floating beam during the individual competition of women in the arts gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle title and in total the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescuon said she's" "" "the best gymnast I've ever seen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the Women's Women's Tournament at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long pathway, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa slightly led through two turns, the picture smelled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspended beams and dentures - in which Biles holds the world title - lurned.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and on the ground a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears poured into Bilhah's brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a margin." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw Kusshausen to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in gymnastics and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, which is a catholic church, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymathematic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so turn classes in the whole country do not look out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and turner primarily in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents for training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their trainers and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs who can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts provide their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must aun the municipalities aun countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastic foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic team and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlet Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accesses the police, election monitors and town halls to have ignored election abuse on the basis of" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should take a badge to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must name just his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not to apply removable inks to a person's finger when they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only to fight electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government against the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>

<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm to the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading out expressions to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as evidence was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Lebanese background.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test by his immune system and Würgereflex, taking off some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a sink in a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the weaning of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was infiltrated under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaning the slit button of a draw toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink, there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he leaned more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer number is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her Luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst that I have ocked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutiny than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let us call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social home after a deletion with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had perforated holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had attached was street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation by residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that will be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish has been found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner forcibly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall housing, said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a deletion is always the last step to take into account Cornwall housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deleting on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house management will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine after she pleaded guilty to the owner of a class B Droge.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>

<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "as far as up to now, it's not about summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - that's what is happening." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electors, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not have to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during holidays there are helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and end votes, only laboriously apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Excitingly, how strongly newbie AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition-day remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatters a bit with the people, just as his legendary ancestor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seeler has got cold feet and chancellor Angela gives the blame for the thriving of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the most beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes an election campaign in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's federal election circuit is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the North-East-CDU largely renounces the usual electoral campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "minor role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you are brushing away the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire for people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any place in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is in the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign fight.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were lagging behind partners CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and put up their electoral campaign largely on the internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is renovated.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything pretty jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a Superteam.</seg>

<seg id="8">The remuneration of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for instance when it comes to the establishment of administrative procedures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg gives rise, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachmannstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many roads were seeking and more familiar with their navigation system than the signage.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led them to breakthroughs makes everyone you ask to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with which note replied, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it's also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his pedigree cuts back after the end of the renovation work, there is no doubt that Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that its host has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some have also left unchecked and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the commentary piece to sow it under the pseudonym Non-Allegration Men's Middle ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGv, the much discussed recovery of vinyl records is not caused by a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought a plate recently, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffy before I stop, keep my hands and say something special to me like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate special shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of discs: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than to buy and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and enjoy spending time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and have caused them to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of supporters of the record of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar mufflers, of objects that wake up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floats from a panel." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I planed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "Trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP to put it into a shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "mop, which has dedicated the records almost an entire floor, has a blower audience than I go." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged adults.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop, instead of experimental jazz, groans from loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naïve mental traumas are hard to detach if you stand by someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the slabs for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a window-window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't earn much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I pretended to discourage the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "disk art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov vote, at least in disk stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record shops and online forums do not take into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning security with bumblebees through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the starring view of an uncanny 30 year false presenter who rages over the shoulders of unsuspecting men of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French tribunal has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to break up 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting the 72 provisional shops but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the Niederreissen was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally served and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants cherished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation speed gauge: in various federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lighters are being tested, which are supposed to transfer templates particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic enforcement bodies of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident areas, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to renovating bridges with temporary temporary polish, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary glitter for compliance with speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days with uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limitationsas well as drive-through bans of time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain in the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated by a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, side-Stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - its first olympic daille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji had beaten a 15-man-team in its best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but probably it won't be - at least a Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had a wonderful start and the attacks poured GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one were running into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau spotted in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle of Mitchell halted the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In seventh minute Vlete jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the kick-off and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou raced through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB is still being taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijivian void... for whole four minutes, what was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt at GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultan, whose fans sang, flags swelled and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked crunched into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the previous day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce half-final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown led the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the coach's cancer for rowing</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotic gold than in these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 tough pieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present when they prevented the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.000 unvarnished commitment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal movement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd, there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no more hindrance than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right word in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Umbration in the existing systems for the so-called" "" "self-current production" "" "in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Western German General Newspaper "(WAZ, Friday edition)."

<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cashier.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry provided additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of growers pushed China into the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price-collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have been stagnating again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt he took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the Deutsche Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, writes Hacklist.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the puff in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia care for long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone exercise so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby doesn't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join in.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this regard, the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as waste.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife of two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and a further person was killed by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb detonation was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation near the beach of Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers, was violated by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone to the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast and in Chumphon at the south-eastern coast called for several injured.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs sent by opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have received secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in the past days - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group lies behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police proved their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always some minor bomb attacks, but usually they are not directed against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives great influence to the military in the coming years as well.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country turned towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody turmoil, will be able to bring the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insurgent uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habasit was subsequently promoted to the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his first run of 48 seconds and won the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more well-known in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussebani took care of media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Memorable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a preliminary race over 100 meters Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussebani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic meter of wastewater amount to 2.10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Germany from October 1, 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a sluggish calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>

<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems at a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Welshochschule, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out the body, a new calculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period will be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious increase in fees resulted in the fact that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very low drainage capacity, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for instance, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have grave consequences.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the back of the calculation period, all three facilities were not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs in a substantial scale.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for world food, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps will come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have reviewed critics in the past, in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and cheered cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow spotted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others voted against the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was "hurtful and the least, was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the abject extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural heritage wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters generates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said Katie Zhu, 25-year-old in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the settling practices of Snapchat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership misses ISIS intelligence services, establishes the Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the armed forces committees, secret service committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically enjoyed by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly posted a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on-site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that governments under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 until the middle of 2015, the Central Command heads changed intelligence reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom are underway by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "gave the highest-level Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "compensated the morality of analysts and" "" "there was moderately little room for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Chief Inspector who received complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions with regard to the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the mine information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the pressures of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's chief commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature due to its excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this is what they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place in their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutchman out of the way the other group starts.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game starts on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and for the first time with three years she had a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to make things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work set in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to completely snatch the helm.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the first half of the game with a knock out of the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory, but the team was surprisingly tough and maintained the range from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the goal to get the American female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously reserved a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not the same every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally accepted: aerial shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have enough arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, it was so sparingly noticed in the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jumping on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and salt) before landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, you will be rated according to execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also another sneezing finish in the television transmission: the world or the olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself feel tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The trampoline vector is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and engagement will be staged on Friday afternoons, at 13.00 Eastern Time streaming; the men on Saturday, also 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a mid-afternoon block from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectivity of male athletes - as the male American turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley anticipates his new fan base according to the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia reached the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protests were killed during clashes with the police at gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shaken the country and spread to more and more regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen fired and killed officers in tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expands at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, although dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have other options except to protest, it breaks off," "" "said Sejm Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been forced more or less in recent years, will benefit from the turbulence and arming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of salivation under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians pointed out that they were so invited to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is inherently dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served as prime minister to Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take over the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many are concerned that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, evidenced by the analysts, apparently by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest was over relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharan city, by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for airplanes over the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who are trying to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining what he did not mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in regard to the statement on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning weet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last whirlwind of criticism falls down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling cargo values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I meant sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then reverse them as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive and then, if necessary," "" "clarify" "" "according to how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corroborated sound as its cargo values have gone back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll from NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he stands in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about Mr. Trump's correctness that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbanks, completely wrong, and so it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing them to get aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being around in each of his words and pretending to be prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, peasant" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered to provide funds for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>

<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic till today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the North Atlantic coast, in an hour, it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives it accelerates the five-meter-long animal to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this long-term lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Evolutionist biologist presumed that Greenland sharks will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion, to some extent, when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishers from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons testing larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, so in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lentil core, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years while the record shark with 502 centimeters could be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals was at the threshold of sexually mature with 392 centimeters and its age was established at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the reproduction obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland expedition, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, rather invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre-election since Arab guests were "challenged" according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the yachting unit Eyachting-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were taken together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romance journey of all the ministrants in two years, the Upper Ministries of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Different pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the Freiburg cathedral to celebrate the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Stormy sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and told the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster's Unserer's wife stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was traded.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis stopped at field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially produced pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parsonances of the local parish were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and firmer dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped on the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, had to first descended around 500 metres altitude at a low temperature and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage goal was welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the lead role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jer made the legend haughty, when he stormed home for a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in due time as Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who prevailed with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner placed an olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was slightly back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, driving in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic board in the final round and the World Champion was defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinder pointed out that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">The form of Kenny is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, which won gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be focused on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested yesterday with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and will be finished tomorrow, Laura defected, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played drama in the background, as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April was set in the midst of sex and Mobbingu, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing.</seg>

<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché plot of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow take part in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it's all about Jenner).</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction of Heavers, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we will already employ 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding HeaShift is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blamusing ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-minded people were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in natural growth and leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the whole of GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle between the open source community and the converters has already been in progress since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdgy atmosphere and slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also profited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus increases its day-side of the sun for almost two months," declared GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escaped with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars revolve at different rates in the star-pile and in what connection are the rotation-periods with the planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the quickest ones.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A well-known athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping events in Rio de Janeiro have been announced before the seventh competition day.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news comes to an unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday that is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon local time, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the finals over 100 m of Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the forbidden substance is about the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B sample should also have been positive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: as perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers from Erpressungs-malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of respondents in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ransomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially extorted ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a horrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebyte Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most paint programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was made horribly fast over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported turnover losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals had already been victims of attacks whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Don't pay, you only fund the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers examined the use areas and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decode for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual extorters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The latest malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware themselves, counseling, and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it comes complete with a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The extorters then are looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">One logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on preventing ransomware from using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not sufficient for successful assessment, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as lists of lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebyte Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The culprits could also completely take on new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hackerconference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are blocking a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the Peugeot 2008 comparable.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI bushing are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep far from the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes can be undermined, emphasised Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you mean for the time being below, however, is the insomnia, that is, an entry and go-through disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the passage of sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German household doctor association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is frequent in depression," "" "says Flemming." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie down badly, wake up every two or three hours and possibly start pondering about everyday problems and worries, gives birth to an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems go to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical strokes only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any sleeping physician in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an examination in sleep laboratory doctors, for example, with snoring with breathing agents, in case of abnormal daytime fatigue, sleep transducers or if one does not find the cause of a transit disturbance, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "said Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After calming, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the sleeping room at the ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="34">There are quite a number of adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">WeBe counts on: regular sleep and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch television for sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler posted a disappointing cutting of the DSV-Team at Olympis via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he made gold for the first time at the world championships in Doha and at the same time placed his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler protected himself via Facebook in front of his former teammate colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €bonus and a jungle-king 150.000 €, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in swimming-sports is bad, the doping controls however are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and not look closely at doping or even operate it." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," "" "he explained." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be kept with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WADA / FINA must not participate," says the election hamburger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain appears at first sight not so, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one gets past playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin-based interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, the police patrol for three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of houses in the sun, others talk about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are mostly genervated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concerns of rising mistress and gentrification." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wishes to make a majority of police protection against the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police arise between house-occupiers and their neighbours, does not appear so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today has a low average income and high poverty rate compared with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990 a number of houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Rīga River.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and scribbers from all over the world: with them residents of GDR times and former house occupations share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which were tossed with coloured bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes involve damages which tend to hit the newly built houses and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a tenancy house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is very important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Riga city anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, architect, her street is not a criminal, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved into Riga's street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that the old residents are pushing.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people - there are more people who don't feel so good," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I cannot approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For people who are annoyed with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from, should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub district, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of the Achim Grockenberger administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, Working Group Refugees, Administration, Authorities and anyone else interfering with.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the icy Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less mocking rather than on the multitude of desired tasks intended - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time now." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Councillor to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not possible to work for private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be rectified, as it is called beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments has it not been done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides a permanent residence there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more seats would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need deals like sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it is just and they can make sense to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever builds the feeling at any time, he cannot help in Urbach, don't work, and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problem cases," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the latest happenings, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some naive might call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also a topic among the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely revocable.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, main and honorary officials have to look out for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new stoke of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is to be answered clearly, the politics atrophy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the old people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
