Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the continuing settlement of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deal between the two continues to deterior@@ ate by the deal raised by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor , his girlfriend has shot to have shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was stuck on a white bloc : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he has shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University of Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal cry at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
before that , Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which the Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight out of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the guards , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his distress call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , more than 4@@ 5.000 employees were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and increase the number of employees from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an ar@@ mes@@ ial of it , to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict of almost five years , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban requested the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollar flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number holds in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to execute his ministry effectively , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters adapt to the idea .
if they expose their a@@ thei@@ sts , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a pol@@ l / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten will say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is apparent that a variety of GO@@ P voters consider Tru@@ mps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has a lead ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration of turning and fishing in public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday 6 out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp will seem to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accounted for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through its out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive living areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a re@@ building house costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which specific layers a square meter cost most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , there is a price like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : dream start @-@ up thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double tor@@ rent in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze made a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; at the FC Bayern in the witch chair of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to rub@@ b@@ ish double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth pole success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
with his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller received a good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the World Champion as a f@@ lange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including prestigious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often introduced by a game shift on the left outside Douglas Costa which rarely came through against former Braunschweig O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct @-@ measure , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
but at Tor@@ beware Manuel Neu@@ er , he was abandoned .
so , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
i@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller was still on top of it .
in front of the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly mas@@ ked Bavarian fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of the host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with kick blocks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
good news : the risk of aband@@ on@@ ment is reduced rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , high@@ lighting the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it may take more than ten years until the haz@@ ards fall back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the British University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of el@@ essness were affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity on the Rhine river Rhine
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
close to the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have dug out skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ation care .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists now became five .
from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the ruins of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train cap@@ tures
after a young woman arrives at the train station in Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei asks the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has borne serious injuries by the Federal Police .
she was treated in emergency medical care and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the educated officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner &apos;s train , a bri@@ ck@@ ish b@@ aker trail , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Street ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and be given free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over the TTIP
to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the competent EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP will inc@@ ur the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be equal parts of the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , but there was no objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own information .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) especially demanded by large corporations is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel adjustment which companies can control damages of the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission considers essential points during the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy singer @-@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative people .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a series of we@@ eds : each of the 50 states of the United States should be followed in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the neighbourhood of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already appeared and had a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , who lives in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a highly celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ding ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs got up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on forehead bands and big lumin@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger ... more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature st@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays with the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one en@@ core requires St@@ ev@@ ens to humble himself , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gments
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is expected to be eag@@ erly anticipated .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questioning and to invest in David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to wait for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several songs @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference said that Labour changes forward to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another political set , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact strength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stri@@ kers , and instead focused on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will be represented in him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pounds rising by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose boun@@ ti@@ fully after data indicating an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid objective SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est assessment since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core climbed 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports bond company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .

met@@ cash starts ground@@ breaking campaign for comb@@ ating al@@ di@@ - diar@@ rho@@ ea
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a gro@@ unding campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes rehear@@ s@@ als in I@@ GA shops and selling store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor @-@ strategy day .
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away some five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the loss in food and food business and volumes on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retailers , which has been supplying about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction in terms of sales and margins at the same time .
however , the wholes@@ aler reserves itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to balance sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers in enhancing their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programmes will be raised to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as a cri@@ tique for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the in@@ famous confrontation between Kyr@@ gios and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon thereafter , in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison , had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f sh@@ ook up a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather en@@ during is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves it to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the decisive preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick made a very quick move to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ary , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency stop and urged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally come into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian stand @-@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the flooded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency standing on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were employed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still needs to appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in a hurry to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 were able to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ did@@ ated for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determined by what candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and women , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it &apos;s the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thrilled above all by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s suppor@@ ter also men@@ tions her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is slightly higher than S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the election of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited for the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being made during the term of office as Secretary of State , most Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in all .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now unhappy with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public opinion of this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse .
they are primarily Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of ten who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights nationwide will also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not have an opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell down the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son goes to the p@@ olls - with 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some side @-@ hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and the Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly inflic@@ ted with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died from the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for Mor@@ der &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of atro@@ cious attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to not only be responsible for the parties involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase of interest is coming , and the household is going to sink , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history for the economy offers little guidance to the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
hence representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in the interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , near Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ fold later in the increase cycle and the return on loans begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in case of an increase in the yield of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the production cycles of 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ hi@@ es were placed in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one that F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve has increased and volati@@ lity has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensified its strategy .
in large and large companies , which deal with the greater part of their business operations in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as a growing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers can see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are as fast as that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pollution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ based colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something which the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was 3 far off his commercial competitor when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I think really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was needed to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only part of BBC production , while hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
he added , he wishes that the company &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment star@@ ed .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the expenses
for more than a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there are indications that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times watched the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fight for bar@@ gains , can prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online was spent online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now online via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the interior cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane crash - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first funeral par@@ ach@@ ings in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia de@@ votes the collapse partly to the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ p .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the beg@@ ging .
the corp@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , imposed a san@@ ction .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man managed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner court yard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims assembled in front of the p@@ add@@ ling that later took place this month .
the Bin Laden group did not issue any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ p as part of the massive construction project , which is managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a transgres@@ sed son , who was dispos@@ s@@ essed by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .

it is alleged that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the chain store chain , said that a large increase in number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which address professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed companies , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the rates after the group failed to pay the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the senior prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used mon@@ ies of association accounts for which they were allowed to dispose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted because of financial mel@@ tdown .
this fact left the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in the absence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created at any time .
the sports officials would have paid only expense allowance and the Sport@@ club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in bread @-@ based corporate audi@@ tor of the financial office .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shot money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , with the corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the reimbur@@ sement will be paid out only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
for this reason , packages and non @-@ detailed bookings also appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us administr@@ ated the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial statements , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation began due to office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , declared the defend@@ ants .
this account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indem@@ n@@ ity indem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told him that he never paid a cent salary , he merely paid o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ eting .
he added to diets 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the exercises were made in cash , so he had to travel from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the US Compu@@ terri@@ fying Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the other hand , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share announced 2.3 percent .
the large group of companies from California Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will be pool@@ ed in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC market as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services replaced the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after the latest Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive set @-@ up of changes in the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers will increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans tot@@ alled about 55@@ ,000 jobs overall .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly come to rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent showed themselves agre@@ eing .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria will find 61 percent positive .
24 per cent oppose the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents said that 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of press at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
the focus of the fair is on 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and e @-@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility Connec@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad audience can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
the organis@@ er of the V@@ DA car association expects about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water lamps against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water laun@@ cher ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first put an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have waited a little far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children that had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ man of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world ob@@ serves when the US st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was still last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ bid , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death penalty at Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left ap@@ olog@@ ation letters &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend at Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb departed his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a PhD degree from the Delta State University as his way of life on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor was also supposed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 managers around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airline company operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit wants to come as quickly as possible with a forecast result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa has moved to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to weeping and closing him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fant@@ astically , and then that happens .
in the changing cub@@ icle he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a rup@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno told me : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the Super@@ camps website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children , as it always seems to be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph where Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ stores an content of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , stream@@ lined being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency bure@@ au .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
the following message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , the run was extended by Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully proposes additional runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton 9 got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I treasure high .
he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
it must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s head of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few wise additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in changing rooms can bring fresh wind even if the messages are in line with the above mentioned .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a noisy situation by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at re@@ affir@@ ms that some member states are deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants to look outside the Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a composite power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will break one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street may be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone ch@@ opping ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ in@@ ali@@ ens that most of our big newspapers have .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on his back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ couch he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints and the wild feelings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can everyone say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the sc@@ outs batt@@ led in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but fighting to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday , what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they critic@@ ised Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y basis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on veri@@ fying efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ making analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the board members are not delivered , but several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are included , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage to most of the products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die each year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ers , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcasting fee , what I do not think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax finances programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ary is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; to BB@@ C@@ 4 should go where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all of us think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Eth@@ ics Mission , &quot; inform , form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ caster Alli@@ ances go to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled from frac@@ tures of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the cube cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ oun@@ ds apply ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fibre , low @-@ frequency ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic viral it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - through a empt@@ iness of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally before our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken a sab@@ b@@ atical year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and pay their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture which is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have spent for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
since you start the Uni at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present oneself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to face sleeping when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate , who added a dish@@ washing agent to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors whether it &apos;s up to them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of them , separate themselves and see them every day and perhaps experience how to bring together all common friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not paint your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ stil@@ er
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need the living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the servant @-@ servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will go to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will rush to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space in the next decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without grounds .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
are building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ d : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly dra@@ fted my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Special Construction and the Stell@@ ar Ord@@ in@@ ance .

it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for that .
refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus @-@ Project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ servant .
I show how you can build cheap and well today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjusting app , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update over iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple made this more impro@@ b@@ able by the result of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is finished .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may switch to half way and this may lead to a breakdown of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stopped for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which received the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation drops it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg room .
a new district office recently opened there .
from now on , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and consul@@ ates will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health care insurance companies .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insur@@ ances are not used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual urban areas of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus loos@@ es an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the show .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury chamber in the Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz Palace in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; park penalty : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tim Wiese sha@@ kes polic@@ ew@@ oman with money &quot; &quot; &quot;
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has gone un@@ noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , in the meantime Tim Wiese was engaged in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , he did not give up on the other hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wiese was just cutting off the hair in the Bremen city center , when he saw how outside a parking atten@@ dant exhibited a criminal set for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the meadow r@@ ushed out of the shop , offen@@ ded the civil servant and threw her in front of his feet , as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide if meadow is shown , or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed the police reports of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young and struck it with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and ble@@ ed heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively over several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue description of the day .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ bei and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the may@@ oral mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also look forward to this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will remain with his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who are currently studying their studies at the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 year old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss to be soon .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the D@@ RK @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon works Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house doctor .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is received by the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ gast @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to practice rock breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers consultation hour are still looking for familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the physicians practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y she already sen@@ sed after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pushed myself outside gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also let the refugees arrive in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
quite so , the Minister of affairs Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to not abri@@ dge its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo to the Serbian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people would approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a further west route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call the details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he inter@@ viewed the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature ejaculation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of getting into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire .
with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made to the financial markets .
in this way , the investig@@ ators were re@@ port@@ edly launched more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other defend@@ ants took place in the event .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exists for 20 years &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , sometimes quick steps , partly sn@@ u@@ g .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
town railways hold .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with stunning autumn sunshine and in the middle of four big tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I &apos;d like .... &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , as well as the voluntary employees .
while some people spontaneously resor@@ ted to chal@@ k and &quot; watched &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences such as &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , the handling of death .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband Sup@@ porters of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone is willing to share in the tables , however , is understandable , and finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still be@@ amed with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although especially the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. used to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 , and despite increased sales for heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted analysts predicted 12 by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts at $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tization in recent years , bringing sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex securities were dropping by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated session in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days a week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
im@@ pending on them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which dis@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial verages 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , lest it panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial verages fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred over the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements associated with apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates an increase in interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the compo@@ unding of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il did not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a raise , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should be ahead of time .

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers get advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ard@@ ine sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ longed Turn@@ h@@ allen@@ bau on Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds progres@@ sed step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ous without large discussions .
prior to this , the Panel had , among other things , an application for an exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ t &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid construction plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mit@@ otic first and roof level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof@@ top for solar panels : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the ra@@ fts , which for energy reasons - different from the plan of construction - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; exceptions &quot; in regard to the pitch - whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der General@@ der@@ at usually proceeds more restric@@ tively in the case of liberation movements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , at Turn@@ h@@ allen@@ bau this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the State Council for Testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , which will take place on Wednesday 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed about the plans .
the change has caused the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game , who agreed to take over the line from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board appro@@ ves , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , acted against rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ a psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi moving to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are called tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .

j@@ agu@@ ar fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police told .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were transported to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei ( Criminal Police ) is determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave him the chance to kill the young people and cast their corp@@ ses into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , which has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered as suspect and conducted the investigation into the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for a young woman , the investig@@ ators first met on the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police station to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se into the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put an end to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conclusions about the immediate circumstances of action are intended to carry out further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid homes .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the tenants .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , there were less than half of all asylum seekers in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also accounts for significant failures in the housing construction policy of the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany shoots a housing deficit in front of itself , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there have already been some 77@@ 0.000 living units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , including Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in big cities in need of accommodation in flat @-@ room flats .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be dispens@@ ed with the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed homes can be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Alliance , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are required .
the funding programme for the refugee shel@@ ters of the German State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees are free of charge : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no passing through , since more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian minister of affairs , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen Area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik border , reports the RT@@ L television station .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter borders .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to swiftly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law classi@@ fies the transgres@@ sion and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south@@ western border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there would have been 40 refugees .
in practice , however , no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the recor@@ ders in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government statements .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor went &quot; str@@ and@@ ed &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the clearing up on Sunday after the bridge , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream , it was &quot; W@@ ern@@ stein concluded , &quot; as Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before that , we first met the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said right away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers climbed to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to try it after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ bound association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , on the day before a two @-@ way return sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures to help ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly tra@@ cked the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to say that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for vulnerable people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad auf der Suche nach 35@@ ,000 winter@@ tight Qu@@ arti@@ eren
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the spreading of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the may@@ hem has already got a grip on the may@@ hem in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big hu@@ stle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad works with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year @-@ long year .
in order to meet the number , there are still 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to deploy countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had conversations with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quarters for the upcoming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ s must comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in placing it on his premises , Konrad explains with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear any costs of the republic , as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , its own quest for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties are currently unable to support these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
criticism is carried out by the Head of the City in the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) de@@ votes further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the relevant border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is desp@@ ised by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building have already been rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ gre@@ t opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wondered if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also not answer the specialist with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are named An@@ ders .
this property also unites some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists , re@@ porters or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy , the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ i@@ dency has stir@@ red up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it via -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which beside Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , arrives at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mau@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a radius , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the investors , she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the village of the investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive say@@ ings of the night @-@ drive .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so pleasant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gro@@ wer in retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I cannot imagine that from the don@@ ald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not know the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side seemed not to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise aver@@ aged 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter@@ Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , aver@@ aged 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 recorded .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a sub@@ stitution for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the b@@ achel@@ or .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ends at the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree , was sh@@ rou@@ ded into the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical ways of explaining why Wood is the perfect man and has his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers might become a game per@@ jury who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now reserved for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victories against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in changing rooms after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .

it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian alliance had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport was leading to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavarian schools , when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state parliament faction of the Free elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as was it during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would need uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not supposed to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing long @-@ term torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level of three to four years will be tested .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high school students wanting to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market closed with profits after a long @-@ distance trend @-@ free and nervous trade @-@ course .
only in the afternoon a fir@@ mer kick @-@ off of the U.S. stock exchanges took a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

solid profits also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 per cent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to take place in the USA until after the interest in the US and also for the great decline on the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and left deep traces in E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the numbers named in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were dropped than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the automobile manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police were using tear gas and then poured into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear immediately why the rubber bul@@ lets used by which are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ un , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there is no concrete offer yet .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , that is the name of the city .
which investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , just a few months ago and the building that is located on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their recreational fu@@ gi@@ um
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group accused of investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ined from the system construction management went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cla@@ d that overlooks all the other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus dischar@@ ges must come so that this is calculated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on exactly one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ weiler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have out@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
instead of making a manager announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised globally will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / as low as 11 million $ .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity surgery has been effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital collected data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgery , 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and in part with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater reco@@ il in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people undergoing obesity , 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which de@@ votes itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he took power , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US tell about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow strong non@@ stop disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reported to report to poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products more and more , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant visi@@ bly while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand sani@@ ti@@ zer ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry and disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold prescribed by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah sounded their words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors sur@@ vey@@ ed them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teachers by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the neglected plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around things , swe@@ ars swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men was followed by Aber@@ deen , which now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need Celtic support , because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that pointed out that he hur@@ ried some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious at the signing of new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
Sh@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could reti@@ re when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not managed to finish Wales this summer .
hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ro@@ ls
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ directed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is clear that the decline in the game field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to fight against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
since security personnel were unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the workers called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could put the stur@@ geons in custody .
a respir@@ ation test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and first remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mak@@ eup lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking about the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few metres from a police officer who tried to sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them to the Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he was standing in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &apos; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good police officer negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing sports
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tick rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy mentioned the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can be thought about it now .
but I arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the rac@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse strip , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday all the day , which was also the case .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on on Monday .
he is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ ses and underground assistance and because of other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beating against ri@@ vals due to alle@@ gations of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring Batt@@ les &quot; with his team during the high storm @-@ victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confident voice , because they worried they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it always appears - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring battles , when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm game against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the Pre @-@ Final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drug trafficking
a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café it could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the vain declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against the security deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks took part in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to leave the last moment to the left , as the police told him .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg accepted the phone of the girl when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of and saw the five images , then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then said to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attorney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year to have viol@@ ated the obligations and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his deal@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings at other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken out of the German @-@ Austrian border , away from the large control points .
many floo@@ d@@ houses were made out of fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,000 refugees were taken up along the river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich Main Station , more refugees arrived after the German police report compared to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner from the Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low low is the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which in recent days moved from the Bermuda Islands to the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , until Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometres of kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years , the high@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations fell into this segment by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents a new entry below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be shown next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer data at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the proposed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the Ju@@ dge of Justice Te@@ gel which was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his ar@@ rests , due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the State of Berlin , failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
court judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detention days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a mer@@ it of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money damage .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only talked to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing agreement with a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always trapped in 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to drow@@ ning it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , apartments are annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments yearly would have to be created and the federal government should invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
on the other hand , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ank@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the compulsory duty to asylum seekers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view is increasingly asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle to access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is , according to Thr@@ ot@@ hardt , the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example , by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for the lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studying willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by the admission to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a resi@@ dency or toler@@ ation do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of un@@ authorised persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ af@@ ö@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will be reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively take the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing state churches right to a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic charity association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
there are also duties on the right .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed of religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a quarter of a decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international agreements like anti @-@ racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany commit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must become reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , according to President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals at the same time when registering health cards .
provided services could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to shor@@ ten so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law provides .
otherwise , doctors mainly do the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical meetings in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children , there are notably more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV awareness .
with the partly other diseases German doctors come from her training , but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the medical angel is concerned , even relief in sight may even be seen by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees even are doctors .
to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are particularly vulnerable .
a recent study conducted by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ cks and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social institutions , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ tle staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get rid of people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast shall conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous nit@@ rous sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with intuition and jo@@ in@@ iness .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are very often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; isn &apos;t it good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena too .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if 5 or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invites you from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions of MPs of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ enbach .
in the last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
expected job reductions lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the conviction that closely aligned companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame about this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an over@@ due time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is a clear favour@@ ites to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first European victory with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more frequent in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ vation ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer boots in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the Ross &apos;s longing for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y care , it told me that ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger myself has clearly shown me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration at this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or even better , if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master along the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk in the group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master because it not only asp@@ ires the qualification for the kno@@ wh@@ ow round but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ame of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not achieve another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold 2 : 2 oun@@ ces in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ lie to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , Celtic in a play @-@ off hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , played with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put him after the restart .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot that was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ yer achieved his sixth season tor , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent stop from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola blocked change to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion League winner , two times club champion , two times champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; he says .
and the registered version of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts Af@@ ro American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not with the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Marti@@ an were strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval by Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after being killed by a white police in 2014 , when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 , the Movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color schemes .
in February the singer Prince played a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all steps of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
climbing on a 75 foot rope in 30 seconds was part of the last task .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about that I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he hu@@ gs any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same when they exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros game for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit spotted three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung well the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed drummer , Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double Play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth session , wall collap@@ sed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the game of injury before the game after he had been missing more than one month for a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the run@@ es in the scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not beaten especially well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and one Walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing since 20 August because of a grip on the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the enriched people are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it expected 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can stay temporarily .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium appointed for the first time , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
even Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Internal Affairs Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , and no one was sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border checks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee transport in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ scored those people who needed protection , they also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this view was expressed in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to set up the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;

although this num@@ b movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon that sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München for several weeks
around one month in 1860 , Munich must ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association with .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to have four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break @-@ break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussion pedal , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie returns to team training next week .
the Austrian national player should start running on Thursday already on Thursday .

contrary to the first fears he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ sh@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first blow @-@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz divided on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer partially blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ler valleys .
after fl@@ atten@@ ing on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn wind blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with bu@@ cks from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ ges of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , moisture begins to st@@ ow on the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ slope .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated , this after the last few days already large amounts of rainf@@ all have fallen .
on Thursday morning the blow comes from the F@@ öhn wind , in the row a cold front with strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east is rolling over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly decreasing .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a place of Martin Luther
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the secret of centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a passing sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have strengthened him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ las@@ sh@@ ale .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown of thorns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is one of the main works of Ot@@ mar Old painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which by no means is equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many topics of the book of all books .
these are cycles which focus on topics such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages based on painting .
he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this makes the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant sovereign Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the education took place with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to carry me back with the Lord father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to restore art again in a faster time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers go into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care to completely grasp the Bible , but the most important , also mysterious subjects selected for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place , company mand@@ ated to model earth hill for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
failures in politics and administration led to dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill deported , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first common student Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga rounds out a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards policies to cope with the problems they face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing to say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive course must face politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs had started their own projects in their own places , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government annually provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already been called up for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP member of the Executive Board loses an eye in case of accident
the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by over@@ throwing at the beginning of July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ mish ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League will definitely sm@@ ash .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ lash against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach has left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its trunk @-@ 11 position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of the chief artist Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , he left the door open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ e@@ word of Mit@@ tist R@@ eus , that the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars according to the Federal Government &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the IAA in Frankfurt at the IAA of a &quot; New Mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic jams , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Transport Ministry emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise in digital radio communications .
there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be br@@ ushed up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on Wednesday results in the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States , account for 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control over the whole trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles .
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who initiated the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing and we became European ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among others , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the duck of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to freeze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
14 tons of material fed the makers according to the c@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashionable foot@@ ing of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him to play .
the throwing of fashion he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they were not given anything , but they could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past it went on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in great quantity for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the gran@@ aries P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the initial times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private trade and wholesale business is almost no longer available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports weak@@ en , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ man in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ painted the historic snow@@ ball .
the machine li@@ cks small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; I was able to do nothing before with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
thus I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic girl girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already strong : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy must open up more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , to ensure a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more openly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investments and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and allow consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding work paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able .
according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m in return for this e@@ asing .
Food@@ watch also described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low bur@@ dened that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sin@@ king of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to the human being , which is strongly enriched by the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts especially in the case of un@@ born damages of the nervous system can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information forwarded by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March out of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish had already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
