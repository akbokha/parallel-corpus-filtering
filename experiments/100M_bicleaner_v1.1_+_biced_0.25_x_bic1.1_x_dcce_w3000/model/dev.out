Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and re@@ jects Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal made by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of Israel that was ahead of its time .
Professor , his girlfriend has been shot in an emergency call
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white bloc : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he killed and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fat@@ eful distress call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb accepted the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the sho@@ ot@@ ings at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea what Lamb moti@@ ved .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a book written by him , Schmidt himself mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared with his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to behavi@@ our@@ al behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight out of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
before he could be arrested , Lamb seriously killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ sto@@ l in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent &apos;s home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ele Johnson said .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had obviously been together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ls Night at night 5th September for the last time , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of humour .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gil guard , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press writers E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that Lamb did the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that they have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor for the holiday season
To@@ ys R Us is saying that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , some 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and increase the number of employees from October to December .
while the holidays themselves are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I &apos;m a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of mine from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the margins of the General Assembly &apos;s Minist@@ erial Meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have proven to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks with surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start to drop their dollars to pl@@ unge it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps Most popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa confirmed last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; content &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son achieves the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favourite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number holds in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 Independent say that his temp@@ er does not fit in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters adapt to the idea .
if they impose their v@@ ows , republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a pol@@ l / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten will say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters consider Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tru@@ mp leadership , while anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp picks up the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico two months ago , the immigration turning and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans out of the Republi@@ can party and humili@@ ate the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l of Monday 6 out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in matters of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems that Donald Tru@@ mp will do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through its out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a re@@ et@@ roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which areas a square meter is the most expensive .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , there is a price like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices at di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double tor@@ rent in Pi@@ raeus . Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympic Games Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start to the &quot; mission Milano . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race .
with his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership , Müller was compensated by Olympic champion Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the World Champion as a f@@ lange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ acher promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 there was also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they ran courage@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their aggressive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left outside Douglas Costa which rarely went through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k arrived from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pol@@ o of Poland by the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct sampling , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ raeus was able to put a needle stick .
but on the door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er it was abandoned .
so for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside initially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Chief Executive Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you want to do something else , this is malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , too , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller put another on it .
in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of the hosts of Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the haz@@ ards fall back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smokers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 were affected by non @-@ violence , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies would have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists run on lef@@ to@@ vers from late Anti@@ quity to Cologne on the banks of the Rhine
archaeological finds were made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the ump@@ teenth time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum dug out skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological excav@@ ation care .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists found it fifty @-@ five .
from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman arrives at the train station in Gei@@ directing ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ der , the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei asks the people for help .
on Wednesday morning , around 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman from the direction of the railway station crossed the rails at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
by recording the train , it carried out he@@ avi@@ est injuries , according to the Federal Police .
she was treated in emergency medical care and transported to a hospital by emergency personnel .
on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly rail crossing of the young woman there is no evidence to the beg@@ ging officials .
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and are given free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over the TTIP
the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its way of functioning , is much more traditional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system for citizens to trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TTIP will be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US select independent judges for a new Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
so far , the parties involved agree on arbitr@@ ators , but there was no objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past months , it became clear that citizens trusted the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration award ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary that companies can control damages of the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act under@@ lined the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ ern ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
during the reform , the Commission considered essential points that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
on Wednesday , when the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) were concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a flip chart showing the in@@ timi@@ dating Fol@@ ks@@ crew recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he talks about different places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , what his min@@ utely and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they came from and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative man .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be beautifully opul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already been released and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live on him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a highly celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic spare parts .
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs got out , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ forehead bands and a large stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature st@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the band plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premi@@ ership &apos;s round of suspen@@ se is anticipated
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s round of the question , and for the first time he will be playing with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commemor@@ ative celebration commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several Tit@@ an@@ eiten @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; respect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference said that Labour changes should be proposed in order to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour Chair , who has promised another political set , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 inspir@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the premi@@ er &apos;s Q &amp; A is confronted with both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with bar@@ bs and instead focused on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the shadow economy minister will be represented in him , if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs extensive reforms .

pounds increases by accelerated aging in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose boun@@ ti@@ fully after data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s objective .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced assessment since 2009 at the time of an increase in net interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index reached an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a leap of 20 % after receipt of the Riv@@ als AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
according to encouraging news from the rival group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ o &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again announces growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports bond company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing force will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans were watching Justi@@ n yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

the fans do not .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the super@@ hero &apos;s advertising break , he spent three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company donated many , many dollars to the be@@ aver bank account .
and with each doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber is also c@@ ashing .
when Justi@@ n Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e go@@ ings too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato @-@ don@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authorities .
as much meat and as much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay therefore doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ amor@@ za launches gro@@ unding campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ amor@@ za tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a gro@@ unding campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food vendors and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump onboard , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and selling store owners who sell dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that further details of its defense strategy will be published on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investors strategy day .
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away 12 months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the volumes on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ gain from interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , metal cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ m &apos;s turnover in food and food business is 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that metal cash would probably disappear within a decade .
in public , Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s food and food trading , which has around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to balance sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers improve their stores through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging infrastructure programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a criticism for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into spotlight with the not@@ orious tribute of Cy@@ ren@@ ian with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon thereafter , in a fi@@ ery quali@@ fier in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; guard would have beaten Cy@@ rene , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook up a potential US Open win of Richard Gas quet , He@@ aly &apos;s Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather en@@ ig@@ ning is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is very tough , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into consideration the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Cy@@ rene &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think that Nick made a very quick climb up to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions understandable .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stop and tigh@@ tened the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all who tried to illeg@@ ally come into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants trapped in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two points of control of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian stand @-@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were brought back from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a meeting in Brussels without a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the corrupt Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation escal@@ ated on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the forthcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a daily basis .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in a hurry to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some gains .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders here is only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democr@@ atically elected voters under 50 years has failed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic elec@@ tors in the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors in the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidates Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President re@@ jects the potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t decide to can@@ did@@ act for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton raises himself in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the most sel@@ ectable is increased .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates give good results in some important features among voters of the election of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being made during office time as Secretary of State , most Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans are now unhappy with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion of this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall views , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of ten who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters throughout the country see Tru@@ mp as dish@@ on@@ est and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but like Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves in a nationwide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times just behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 members of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp had found some side hi@@ stories for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday , during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and claimed one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the good of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies from the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for Mor@@ der &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to make the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase of interest is coming , and the house@@ wife gets into trouble , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy offers only little guidance on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so sharply stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could however find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rate of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset income is stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after it ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ured later in the increase cycle and the return on investment began to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , at 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and only 1.5 percent are expected for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an interest rate of the F@@ ed year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all height @-@ enhancing cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and rec@@ alled pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , since the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic direction .
in the case of bonds , ren@@ ders seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the loans dropped immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large companies , which engage the greater part of their business operations in the United States , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt is a big problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers can see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pollution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously @-@ called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC CEO rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that he must work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only factor in BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to tramp@@ le on commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media at a cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; on a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house cow@@ shed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to include more rows of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from ear@@ t@@ do@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible for this
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in the year 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales de@@ xes the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers hold their purchases in front of this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium had found out that there was a little more than £ 1 online out of £ 5 .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the shopping is now done through web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the in Mec@@ ca during crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Lad@@ ens &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead which were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ p .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the al @-@ Mo@@ renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell upon the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , hung up a san@@ ction .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane hur@@ ried through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have to steal the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man went to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ p as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia &apos;s family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a stun@@ ned son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured get half of this amount .

because Britain is increasingly employing arti@@ sans to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the chain store chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which address professional tra@@ des@@ people and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment the men prevail over the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a drop in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover , after the Group had shoulder the cost of closing shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and distra@@ ction on Wednesday at the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ furt .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used money from association accounts in 2006 to 2011 for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 .
he figures the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
sports officials are also indic@@ ted because of financial mel@@ tdown .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
on the occasion of the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point was the association an asset .
the sports officials only paid expense allowance and the Sport@@ club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the bread@@ board of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shot money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , you are not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , in the case of the respective financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore I have paid out a portion of the reimbur@@ sement only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
for this reason , packages and non @-@ detailed entries appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and pass@@ books managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments have not been disclosed in detail to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial burden , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation began due to abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , declared the defend@@ ants .
this account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association , according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indem@@ n@@ ity indem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added to diets 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not instruc@@ t accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the kilometre allowance .
in his statement , he stated in his statement that all deport@@ ations had to be made in cash , for which he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will continue to build further jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the U.S. Compu@@ terri@@ fying Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share announced 2.3 percent afterwards .
the bo@@ oming corporate group from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto is currently expanding : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services made the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last year .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus , revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP answers the changes in the industry with a split up and massive sub@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers will increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more stores online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly be rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated : 54 percent opposed it , 35 percent expressed themselves con@@ sent@@ ing .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents said that 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of press at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus of the fair is on September 27 networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and e @-@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility Connec@@ tivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organis@@ er of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expects about 900 000 visitors just two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used tear gas and water @-@ lamps at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ lamps against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border check@@ point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
there was a police line behind it and a water @-@ light was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first put an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now waited a little more cau@@ tious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and evi@@ dently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries because of the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University sent letters of ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb departed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday said there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter , the 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , had been living with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb has called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb departed from his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doctorate from the Delta State University as well as his curriculum vit@@ ae on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett because of cancer .
the actor was supposedly struggling with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 managers around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa buil@@ ts its corporate structure and upgraded its low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer managing directors for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year , cockpit hopes to come as quickly as possible with a predicted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record result &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it envis@@ ages that Lufthansa Cargo is moving to the Group &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ Line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered double frac@@ tures of his right leg in the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defender to cry and closing him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has it very hard and then plays fant@@ astically , and then that happens .
in the changing cub@@ icle he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then lasts for six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how ruined I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be .
I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ b@@ lage by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided on Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the Super@@ camps web site and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead re@@ stores an index of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads one . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book . here is an un@@ named boy , as the local environment is devast@@ ated by the prot@@ rac@@ ted , tree @-@ prone , Th@@ ought frustr@@ ating once @-@ eag@@ les , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency bure@@ au .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
pushing for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der that has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on the test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I &apos;ve said that - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , the barrel of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire will result in another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t deliver so good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in and he is a bu@@ zz@@ ling man I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those in front of him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four qui@@ cks , turned up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a Teufel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately abol@@ ished three hundred rams and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that lift their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some wise additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in changing rooms can bring fresh wind even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .

some will not agree , but coaches and team champi@@ ons do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of the UK from the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s dis@@ gor@@ ed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C fighting viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states are deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of its own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climbing on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not let us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .

Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will break one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scottish exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is susp@@ ecting my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street may be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , but were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ m ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
this included Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone @-@ ch@@ opping ali@@ ens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ in@@ ali@@ dates that most of our major newspapers have .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly t@@ aps on his back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints and the wild feelings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ dom can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , still what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the sha@@ ggy bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV 24 / 7 and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which at the start of Monday I was reminded of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with compounds to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they critic@@ ised the evidence that Public Health England ( P@@ he ) critic@@ ised in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on veri@@ fying efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ making analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the board members are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the P@@ he &apos;s tobacco management took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally signi@@ fies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage to most of the products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people are dying every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by demonstrating current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ary , says former Head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ ern@@ ary and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that do not make or commissioned others .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ary is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC in general .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for serial , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ern@@ ary .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , we all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , I wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain &quot; on public television channels in Australia and Canada .
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and enter alliances with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ up of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the cube cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ oun@@ ds the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are available at bus stops and subway trains that require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank .
in September , a flock of weapons dealers will ride with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the cease @-@ fire show .
the 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of gru@@ es@@ ome designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of the bus stops are on the planet . &quot;

the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist who works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - through a empt@@ iness of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will stick more strongly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that tor@@ turers are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the world of weapons comes from within the scope of Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from easy to nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , where you come from , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often transform into drinks reception , film night events venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and pay their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert gets a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stro@@ lling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have spent for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos swa@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
since you start the Uni at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate , who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors , if it was something to make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before making their own music loud , shut down their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she treats all common friends to herself ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is more subtle than it seems .
a good place is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , squ@@ at@@ ters
the real estate entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner builds row @-@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the servant servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will rush to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a large part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units , each with four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the specific needs .
what are the costs ?
the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ d : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legally , I correctly dra@@ gged my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated there is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Special Construction and the Stell@@ ar Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when it &apos;s released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to wait for either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has rendered this more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch off half@@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second emphasized before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the world champion from the race in Singapore this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous 12 races , taking the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stopped for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st grade and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , who received chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ist ft &quot; have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office recently opened there .
from now on , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions like care insurance or health and care insurance .
for years , we have established with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not seldom fulfilled because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ wife Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist ft and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis perfectly complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual city districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 am .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus gave an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the show .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the eigh@@ ties he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg Wiener Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz into the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellectual , on the other hand , did not give up .
he had just cut his hair in Bremen &apos;s inner city when he saw a car park guard left out there for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Wiese was r@@ ushed out of the shop , offen@@ ded the official and threw it in front of the feet as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences of the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide if meadow is shown , or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mouth : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mouth .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young and struck the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al sin@@ us and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a head@@ stock , it was checked on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue description of the day .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was wearing a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Heinrich fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms acquired Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll years ago , who are currently studying their studies at the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the double family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in honorary capacity in the DRC &apos;s willingness to detect Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon works Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house doctor .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is received by the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25,000 euros ) and from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ congregation Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found it , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hours , by the way , continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y she already feels after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and enjoys travelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also crossed at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to provide asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also let the incoming refugees travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia wants to not abri@@ dge its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass on T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country will host about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people would approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been travelling the whole night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ situated route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive control of border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners have a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s media reports they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local evi@@ denti@@ ary in Hor@@ gos : he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be about very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of getting an insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ken@@ nel and PR News@@ wire .
with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other defend@@ ants took place in the event .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim exists for 20 years
the company is operating around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , sometimes quick steps , partly lei@@ surely stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city railways keep .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted by mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , as well as the voluntary workers .
while some people spontaneously resort to the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; read the war , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet , &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , the handling of death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realise that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone is willing to share publicly on the boards , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still stuck with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ th@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant belongs to the honorary staff of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers by calling , it was immediately reported and was there during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ th@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives are accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his winning outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Prof@@ its between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts predicted , according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher beats for bo@@ d@@ hau@@ lage of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects that the result will increase compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; yields solid yields by considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted the analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts predicted six analysts predicted to be $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a drop in international priority shipping , which generated sales in his unit expe@@ di@@ ted shipping .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net transport sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while earnings dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the dead for the first time for nearly a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is located on one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data from the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - even by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which dis@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress to increase the sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cho@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnish , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rate of interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as breaking the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not coming close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should hurry the time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
ja , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe für Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still fond of teaching with her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday they are doing it in the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried authorised the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn of the gymn@@ asti@@ cs at the Bern@@ ward sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent Assembly meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
prior to that , the Panel had , among other things , decided on an application for an exemp@@ li@@ fying &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; from the current plan of construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mit@@ ed first and roof over@@ hang is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn was about the ra@@ i@@ ding , which for energy reasons - unlike in the plan of construction - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of planning per@@ mitting no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the pitch prop@@ ens@@ ity - although the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; municipal council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally proceeds more restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Turn@@ h@@ allen@@ bau , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger says .
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated on costs .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports promotion .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Federal Council for Testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board meets on Wednesday 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au shall be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed about the plans .
the change has caused the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ et @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game , who agreed to take over the line from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
over the next two years , f@@ isher with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , obj@@ ected to what the house , which is owned by the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity cannot come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .

hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police announced .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei investig@@ ates .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
as indeed a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , who gave evidence according to the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met on the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
with surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the suspi@@ ci@@ ons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then took the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee gave the authorities the police stop to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday ; the investig@@ ators put him in charge .
conclusions about the nearer conditions of action are intended to carry out further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also accounts for significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing construction policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a deficit of housing that gets bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are some 70@@ ,000 units missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in flat @-@ room flats .
young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be temporarily suspended .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters by the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled on Monday night with EUR 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free admission : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that it is possible to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian minister of affairs , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is not a Schengen country yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the closure of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reported the RT@@ L TV station .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot via the green border .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
mine clear@@ ers will now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people of attack .
shortly before the closing on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law classi@@ fies the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established transit zones on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees holding up there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers shall be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in the vicinity of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier bars have been disman@@ tled and one of the recor@@ ders in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reach a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor went &quot; str@@ and@@ ed &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge &apos;s feast on Sunday we were busy cleaning up when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
but because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the ri@@ ms along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we first met the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was de@@ posed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ b@@ lower @-@ run sporty - organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediate help in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly articul@@ ated the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad searching for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof neighbour@@ hoods
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad became fully involved with the refugee flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the original reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placement of the 20,000 refugees coming to Austria on Monday was without a big hu@@ stle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad answered and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all Konrad works with a demand of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ ts in the year @-@ long year .
in order to fulfil the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had conversations with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quarters for the next refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum seek@@ er also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that employer gi@@ vers must comply with a certain amount of towel holders or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ rad explained that in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was more successful with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man who doesn &apos;t say the truth without further ado . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear any costs as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , one &apos;s own quest for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties concerned can currently be prevented without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , additional locations should be checked for their suitability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism is carried out by the Head of the City of the Refu@@ ge@@ es within the Federal State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders will not be sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) outlined the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the relevant border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the job@@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T has moved into being , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is desp@@ ised by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building have already been rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opens second business in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now grown in the form of a further business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve wondered if I should open a store again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women are rap@@ ed at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , neither can the specialist answer with the last certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are named An@@ ders .
this property also unites some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself hostile to journalists , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ her is a name for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to it about -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about their goal to become most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz is among them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , arrives at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the King of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; though there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the initi@@ ator , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the investors .
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundations of the real estate group were first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz belonged at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive say@@ ings of the night @-@ drive .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner retired rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension association Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally good ank@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not know the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have never been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no great shifts in the reviews for today .
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the Ab@@ road seemed not to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise aver@@ aged 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared with today &apos;s € 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has been closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , aver@@ aged 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the b@@ achel@@ or .
the woman at which Sam Wood has finally landed at The Bachelor &apos;s degree has been sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical ways of why Wood is the perfect man , and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a gam@@ bler who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian team had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the blow and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 year old .

the State Conference of the Free vot@@ er is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in the metrop@@ olitan city should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ term long @-@ term torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; middle @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the secondary high @-@ secondary school of three to four years was tested .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high school students wanting to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has been closed with profits following a trend @-@ free and nervous trade course .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the U.S. stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized scores won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ stat 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s operating deficit decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
the commercial grounds in London and Paris also recorded solid profits .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock exchanges assume that markets until after the interest @-@ decision in the US and also on the big decline in the terminal markets will appear on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to record low levels and left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack some 30 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave the German chip@@ maker too little attention .
investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were dropped than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler and BMW cars increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits continued to increase by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on exchange of listed German securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro dropped to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon .
at noon the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .

4 people killed after police officers shot rubber bul@@ lets in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal in Nepal where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ ang@@ u , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lators ha@@ sten@@ ed the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den youth centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , trade and hab@@ itation is planned - but there is no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4,000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great street , just a few months ago and left the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor first presented public plans for the project .
several residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ elling of their leisure facilities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Building , &quot; publicly presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , who accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
intense reactions among the land@@ owners who came to the meeting caused the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , member of the sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers and board member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that sur@@ passes all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ ses so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is exactly on the area of the grounds of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ weiler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled off the European nations , as they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager notice the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million at goo@@ gle@@ .com / low to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many of them fled from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes follow after weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to consume food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obesity @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c mu@@ ff@@ ing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation sun@@ k from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent compared to the diabetes and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass Sur@@ gery Group had lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater reco@@ il in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and posted a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 per cent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming to persons with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is growing attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide demanded an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he took power , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swallow strong alcoholic hand @-@ dis@@ infection products , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased in children under 12 years of reporting the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand sani@@ ti@@ zer ) are those perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ath@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry qu@@ ino@@ a disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is prescribed by an adult in law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor treating her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ath@@ jah wa@@ ved her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by alcohol and pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tho@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ y@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection and to store hand dis@@ infection products outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
co @-@ workers from health authorities suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teachers by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the tel@@ eg@@ ated plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver went on the cross@@ roads towards the roundabout industrial area and realised too late that two approaching vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he hit the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the vehicles involved in the accident , a material damage of about 10,000 euros was generated , the police shared .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ ra@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede on Dis@@ cord
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismissed spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm Games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen followed , which now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need Celtic support , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Ziel@@ ona Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome ank@@ le for two years and did not manage the descent from Wales this summer .
hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ra@@ st@@ les
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with infectious texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ mos@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le , if it doesn &apos;t play Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee United Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to make things happen - but it is clear that the decline in the game field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to fight against Hamilton &quot; un@@ nice . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cords in order to see a seventh consecutive League victory , giving them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ CT of 5.5 percent , as demonstrated by the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the sc@@ ot@@ tish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unk@@ ards interfer@@ ed with the process
since security personnel were unable to save the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could put the stur@@ geons in custody .
a respir@@ ation alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 subjects and at first remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew nearer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; able to form@@ ulate better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to mention all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few metres from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a break @-@ off incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was standing in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the race
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt ta@@ xing test at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy mentioned the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , reign@@ ing President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ved in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and break myself , and I have no doubt that what I say can be thought about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which b@@ umped against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have happened yesterday evening .
it would have been the whole day like that .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the day of racing . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend of a collision with a cycl@@ ist and followed driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured rider .
a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on on Monday .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and under@@ stated assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable condition .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals due to alle@@ gations of ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described critics of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fighting &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ ed note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defending the tac@@ king lim@@ b of his team and said that they were focused solely on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence , because it was worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring competitions , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time of the year emerges again and again .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; thrilling football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a dre@@ dge .
but now he has a team that can play and which we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm game against R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
when they tell us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team will be free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks in the final Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 US $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei found 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ s his Australian and Serbian pass , reports to the police daily and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening a truck driver was severely injured .
two of the three trucks took part in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing system was torn apart completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ interrupted pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police looked after the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then said to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it was a addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching was done on the computer by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on June 14 last year , to have been viol@@ ated against the obligations on 25 January this year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg did not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , because it could be argued that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in its off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael closed the verdict by October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases .
he was included before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
drag on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many people fear the discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in the county of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot through bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich Central Station , in comparison to the beginning of the week , a considerably more refugees arrived on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by 8@@ am alone around 700 people arrived in the provincial capital , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner of Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest Exp@@ ected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm trage@@ dies in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which in the last days moved from the Bermuda islands over the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D there is still early on Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the masses are doing it : every two years , the motor@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations fell into this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Office of the Automotive Industry ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time ever .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be driving on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door car in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes to the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan brand wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will have a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer data at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hands on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prisoner of the correc@@ tional institute Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot@@ ing , was transferred to a larger cell .
his position of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days of compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were decisive for compensation , it was said that there was a compensation claim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Appe@@ al Court must now clarify the amount of money damage .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
in April , they only agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to human rights , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a in@@ decent housing agreement to a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 to 21 hours in a same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always trapped in 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness is rising , even to drow@@ ning it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in light of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , apartments are annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise and the federal government should invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
at the same time , scientists and federal government ministers agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligatory duty to asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the point of view is increasingly asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is , in the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt , the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration established that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the tuition classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin School Administration .
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a re@@ payment or toler@@ ation do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ ail , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to a ban .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this can be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get immediately af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing state church law to a new state religion relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic charity organisation which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights include duties too .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take a heart against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , forcing the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general gender equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant women and interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and which international agreements like the anti @-@ racism Convention on Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the previously expected refugees , says Professor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals at registration health cards .
achievements rendered could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited service catalogue , which the Asyl@@ um Performance Act fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors mainly do the language barriers .
as early as so , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , translation costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly other forms of disease , German doctors come from their training , but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the medical don@@ ka is concerned , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , and several refugees were even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong sho@@ cks and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , stated Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social institutions can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , welfare workers or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ag@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ otyp@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to appeal lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and arti@@ stry .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little else and fascin@@ ates with her mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic with different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a position : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena as well .
so the highest command : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if 5 or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all their heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with invo@@ king .
last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the parliamentary members concerned that the immunity in Parliament ends , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and service activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard for producing electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the belief that closely focuss@@ ed companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame about this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 which have recorded the most injury stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and treat the players who need it to take a little snow@@ fall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s favour@@ ites are to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the club to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated by suicide among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more frequent in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ vation ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) launched in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communications managed via social media , with emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation prev@@ ails .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health a lot more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football jer@@ king in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can always refer to it , even though they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone pastoral care explained to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status via phone to help people in moments of despair may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ fleet Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head @-@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , because they do not only aim for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ame of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not achieve another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian flu@@ ff was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ di@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps pointed posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed in the first half with no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after having used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short of the hour stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season tor , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent stop from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a goal at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add@@ Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion League winners , two times club champion , twice World Champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the start of the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid has won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .

&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ting Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the filling of the film and not with the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Marti@@ an became strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media began to explo@@ de before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after being killed by a white police in 2014 , when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ ose who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
climbing on a 75 foot rope in 30 seconds was part of the last task .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he hu@@ gs any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to ascend within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it &apos;s coming , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit included three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the whi@@ stle well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better out in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy handed over the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed drummer , Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the major league leading the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double Play
after installing a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth session , Wall posted a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the injury list before the game , having been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the start I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit especially well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four ke@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throwing school .
he is being examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is crossed off from the offen@@ ding list to fight the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing since 20 August because of a grip on the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the enriched people are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , like the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it expected 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can stay temporarily .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the Pres@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gi@@ essen , responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
even Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for one possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
after Germany Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV broad@@ caster ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of an agreement after Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria for the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee strike in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and announced that on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who needed protection , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who have no prospects for lead can also not stay in Germany .
this view was deeply divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to set up the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants have made their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon therefore sw@@ aps easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this num@@ b movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already longer known that there must be liquid water under the cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ ese , vom@@ iting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers shut at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not resolved .
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München for several weeks
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce about a month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as training guest the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger ru@@ by Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training again next week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is to join the running training .
Ok@@ oto was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a heavy collision at the head .
contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious ble@@ eder .
no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In most cases , however , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support the body &apos;s vision , immune system and metabolic processes .
when bought , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the color alone doesn &apos;t tell us how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS once again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 aid kits for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already begun with recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .

already last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .

first blow @-@ on , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps , the F@@ öhn wind through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz scored on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night for Thursday the hair dryer partially blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ler valleys .
on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn wind blows in the F@@ öhn @-@ valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and in the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here rain starts , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated , depending on the amount of rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the air is blowing , in which a cold front rolls with a powerful , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind is refresh@@ ed up to stor@@ my , and temperatures drop considerably .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther number in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
according to Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , on Wednesday rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ iner mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a perfect sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
with his theses , Luther had initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden crown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown is one of the main works of Ot@@ mar Old painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motives formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many topics of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
thus he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transl@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into current connections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant ruling Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to carry me back to my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to restore art again in a fast time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is now em@@ bos@@ sed by advertising , and it is noisy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being replaced .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care to completely grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s all about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model the ground for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already finished .
failures in politics and administration led to dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill deported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first common student Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B enlar@@ ges its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga matches a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards policies to cope with the problems they face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle nobody can say that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive course has to put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal lists support this program as well .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs are setting a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can be football players , no , we need to use our power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was talking about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
in the European Championships against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government annually provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP Managing Director loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he dropped to a glass jar at midnight that he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out of the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus had finally broken in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen again , the BV@@ B coach has left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its trunk ge@@ e@@ 11 at the R@@ eus location .
he announced a change on the position of the tor@@ ped@@ o .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of chief artist Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he is trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
whether wil@@ low prop@@ eller is deployed in future in all Europa League matches , Tu@@ va left the door open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ e@@ word by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final campaign for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance of picking up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the process of changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show in a &quot; New Mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the Ministry of Transport has emphasized , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise in digital radio communications .
a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use around the world to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to be expected far beyond 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe 31 percent at all .
Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey by the Digital Federation of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ Euro
according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf @-@ Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship meeting in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ ster in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also lacking , and we have become European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was putting men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I was the duck of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the stunning collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely surviving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to freeze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot left 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he then taught himself to dis@@ miss fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , who would like to apply them for example to ceilings and she@@ ers .
this is not working anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the gran@@ aries P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styl@@ istic eras , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no more private specialised shops and wholesale outlets .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the United States .
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to raise awareness of how C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer is explained by the Stick@@ man in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic snow@@ ball peak .
the machine li@@ cks small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional pr@@ elu@@ de lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en Point - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surrounding area and would like to have a souvenir .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new film adaptation , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI push@@ es to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy must open up more broad@@ ly to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new impetus and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guide group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border checks policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more openly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers deleg@@ ated to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part in the meeting as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Food@@ watch &apos;s consumer organisation , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be obj@@ ection@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m according to Food@@ watch .
Food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ cks , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ bur@@ dened that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched with predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts especially in the case of un@@ born damages of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ing of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is transported into the environment by coal combustion .
according to a written information by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations drive up more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity it is issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide coverage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish had already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
