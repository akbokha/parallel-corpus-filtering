a ) The technological development in the field of securing measures is fully taken into account in the implementation of safety measures according to this Convention , and all efforts are made to ensure optimal cost effectiveness and the application of the basic principle of effective securing monitoring of the core material , which is subject to this Convention , by using instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points as far as the current or future technology allows this .
B ) For guarant@@ e@@ eing optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ering as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ;
III ) Con@@ cent@@ ration of the verification procedures on the phases of the fuel cycle that may affect the manufacture , processing , use and storage of nuclear material , which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core explosive materials , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention .
a ) The Community of the Organization in accordance with this Convention inform@@ s the Community of the Organization in accordance with this Convention Information on Nu@@ clear Material , which is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the systems which are for the implementation of the securing measures in relation to this material of bel@@ ang .
B ) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention .
II ) Information on systems is limited to the minimum required for the use of f@@ use measures in relation to nuclear material , which is subject to the safety precau@@ tions according to the Convention .
C ) On request of the Community , the organization is ready to test investment data , which respects the community as a particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community .
these data do not need to be transferred to the organization materi@@ ally , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community with no further access .
a ) i ) The organization cat@@ ches the approval of the Community and States to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
II ) Re@@ qu@@ ires the Community either against either proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a subsequent designation , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative names .
( III ) In accordance with the re@@ peti@@ tive ref@@ usal of the community to appro@@ ve the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are hin@@ dered by this convention , the Council will discuss ref@@ usal , following the Director General of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the General Director &quot; - that deals with the aim of meeting appropriate measures .
B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually gro@@ use them according to their conven@@ tions .

each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization .
the safety precau@@ tions according to this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material when the community and the organization state that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity , which is not usable or virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to this Convention , the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear materials as soon as the receiving state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisation carries out documentation from which any transfer and , if necessary , the use of the backup measures to the given core material .
if nuclear material , which is subject to the provisions of this Convention , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacturing of alloys or ceramics , the Community agre@@ es with the organization of such a use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material .
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community ensure that the backup measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
the provision shall be determined as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these coll@@ ateral actions will not be applied .
in any case , the backup measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is restored to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective State or the States concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or states on the ongoing basis .
this explains her agreement as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or conce@@ al@@ ment of the military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs incur@@ red by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the Community , the States or the persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation shall rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se such costs , provided that it has been prepared beforehand in advance .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be am@@ ended to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the States .
any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state for damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - has been asser@@ ted in accordance with international law , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident .
after verification of the relevant information presented by the Director General , the organization is not able to verify that no core material that must be subject to this Convention , may rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the reports provided in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and may also take the other measures en@@ vis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account what mass has been acquired by the applied securing measures , and offers the Community or the State - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state consult@@ ations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention will be reviewed by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council invites the Community and the State concerned to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes referring to the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which are not included in the negoti@@ ation or by another by the organization , the Community and the States , shall submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ap@@ point two arbit@@ rators ; the organization also identifies two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbitr@@ ator judges elect a fifth , who runs the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the organization are named within thirty days of the application for an arbitr@@ ator not each two arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth ump@@ ire has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall act for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and
II ) When the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other on request of one of the Parties to the amend@@ ment of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Manager shall inform all Member States of the organization immediately of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when conducting the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures of the safety precau@@ tions specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence of such a reduction by the risk of early discovery .
for the purpose of sub@@ mitting the purpose specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ally with spatial integration and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance is specified for a certain period of time , indicating the limits of accuracy for the specified Me@@ gen .
the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the community &apos;s security system to carry out its veri@@ fications .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , will fores@@ ee how they are determined closer and expedi@@ ently in the supple@@ mentary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , derived , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
( B ) the assessment of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proc@@ ed@@ ures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of not measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which design@@ ates the core material and the changes of this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) arrangements that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety precau@@ tions according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) is ur@@ anium - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , introduced into States , the Community of the Organization shares the amount and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Rel@@ eases core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is subject to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ du@@ es , so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community determine that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to the Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such material is non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which lies over 80 % .
on request of the Community the organization fre@@ es nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided the total amount of material delivered in the states is no longer at any point in time than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ograms of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which may consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ plying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if fre@@ ed core material is to be processed , processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization supple@@ mentary agreements , which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization &apos;s tasks are successful and effective , in detail how the procedures prescribed in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mentary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention can enter into force ; an extension of this period requires the establishment of the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report stated in article 62 , the organization presents a summar@@ ized inventory of the entire , the securing measures of this convention underlying core material in the States , not@@ with@@ standing its origin , and continues to carry on this inventory on account of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Co @-@ operation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound to force within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve that goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the organization consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the Mittel@@ bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC organization has presented a table from which it is evident in what manner it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization is governed by a special account under the term &quot; special action account &quot; which the member states contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is managed and used by the organization as a ste@@ ward ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and depos@@ ited at the organization &apos;s depos@@ iting point in the country concerned .
B ) The payment will be made in two rates , and ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the article bin@@ ds within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administration agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the article on 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed upon by the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual household plans .
C ) E@@ ach member state may be able to pay the payments before the above dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional representation on the cash or the school jun@@ ks in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and balance the special transaction in a reasonable manner .
in gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors under the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and predict@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit capacity to loan terms and conditions without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction contract serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered , evaluated , approved and administered for the funds provided by the Organisation ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction marks are subject to the same return payment terms , which apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of age in 50 years .
transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that preser@@ ves it .
every transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from each transaction contract can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services that are made or rendered in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and who , according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ aker has appointed at the time of loan granted , could be the benef@@ ici@@ ary of a special transaction loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be with@@ drawn after its receipt as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State .
the administrator noti@@ fies the E@@ EC to the complete assignment of all the transaction &apos;s loans to the E@@ EC on the purposes and programs approved by the directors in preparation for inspection by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction period , the car@@ et@@ aker inform@@ s the E@@ WG quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction and the expendi@@ tures made there@@ for .
the ste@@ ward transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this conclusion .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC will send an extensive report on the projects and programs funded by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the transaction account , which are apparent from the accounts pay@@ able to the account and deposits paid out of the account and deposits on the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of thoughts about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction proposals and on any other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement entered into force on December 31 , 1978 or at a later point in which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notes the conclusion of their proceedings to the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Secretariat General condu@@ cts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement through the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter changed to the amend@@ ment of the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ CE AS@@ SO@@ CI@@ ATION :

BI@@ Z could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of fees paid by the credi@@ tor country to the Mechan@@ ism Mechan@@ ism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this equ@@ ates to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions have been mentioned , for which the BI@@ Z would be willing to use .
in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ Z would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without having exceeded a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their event@@ ual renewal , BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with lamb and lamb
I ad@@ ore to take part in the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties have agreed as follows :
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure an imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should any change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under Number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes the protective cl@@ ause , it oblig@@ es itself to take care that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the Community market is not affected .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the community agre@@ es to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
during the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set out under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall be taken into account under the number of 5 test@@ es mentioned above .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is established with the day of the accession of Greece to the Community on 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community is taking everything to avoid market development that could affect the commerci@@ alization of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the communal market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by gran@@ ting quantities of export licenses that are specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under Number 1 .
the community is oblig@@ ated to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products is made dependent on the template of an export license issued by the competent authorities designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details for the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence may be wai@@ ved for the products in question .
it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authorities of the Community in regular intervals interven@@ es the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these data may be en@@ code if necessary according to destination country .
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions that are of importance for the target so called 7 .
the committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be imp@@ aired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned collective bar@@ gaining numbers according to the Community .
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be exemp@@ t from the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the GAT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 January .
the quantity applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total volume of the year and accounts for the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the area of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;

C ) which are not free from diseases of blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is accompanied by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ eled before ster@@ il@@ isation .
after completion of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution may not exceed 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre .
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined by the blood cells and ser@@ um beforehand ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
if there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable .

to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis is to take compounds that do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods that reduce this risk in a comparable manner .
one of the amount of liquid that is used in the production of plasma is to add a corresponding amount of water ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that it has been produced ; the solution is subject to the following tests :
II ) If one remo@@ ves 1 ml solution a sufficient quantity of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , then co@@ ag@@ ulation takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furn@@ ace at 37 C .
due to the 24@@ stage drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ d under a pressure of at most 0.0@@ 2 mm mercury , weight loss may not occur at the human dry plasma loss loss .
human dry plasma is contained in a nitrogen ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle with exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and by the possibility of any moisture ; it is to be protected from light and to keep at a temperature below 20 C .
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are specimens from the protein component , which consists of about 60 % of the total protein of the plasma of the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred .
regardless of whether the final product is to be flu@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation must have been heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C after adding a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container for 10 hours to activate the path@@ ogen of the viral h@@ epatitis .
in preparations made of human alb@@ um@@ ine , at least 95 % of the mass of the available proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in .
in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present .
if the final product is fre@@ eze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product .
if the fraction is made of human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per litre .
if human alb@@ um@@ ine is produced as a solution , there must be a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre .
comparative measurements of vis@@ cos@@ ity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ ations with the ultra @-@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis that are made before and after heating are not allowed to indicate signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of the dissolved proteins .
