<seg id="712">A) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. however, the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material, which is subject to this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The security measures provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided the organization and the community determine that this core material is practically non-refundable.</seg>
<seg id="714">On request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the securing measures according to the Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material, if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments;</seg>

<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If freed core material is to be processed, processed or stored along with core material, which is subject to, processed or stored in accordance with this Convention, precautions are taken for the re-use of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organization supplementary agreements, which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization's tasks are successful and effective, in detail how the procedures prescribed in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention can enter into force; an extension of this period requires the establishment of the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report stated in article 62, the organization presents a summarized inventory of the entire, the securing measures of this convention underlying core material in the States, notwithstanding its origin, and continues to carry on this inventory on account of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Co-operation, in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general resource problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound to force within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve that goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the Mittelbindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the EEC organization has presented a table from which it is evident in what manner it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization is governed by a special account under the term "special action account" which the member states contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this agreement; this account is managed and used by the organization as a steward (in this property the organization is referred to as "administrator"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special action account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the organization's depositing point in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment will be made in two rates, and (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the article binds within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administration agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance of the article on 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed upon by the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual household plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each member state may be able to pay the payments before the above dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker takes about proportional representation on the cash or the school junks in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and balance the special transaction in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors under the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and predictable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit capacity to loan terms and conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction contract serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly payable development program or project (including a sectoral project), regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices which are considered, evaluated, approved and administered for the funds provided by the Organisation (b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction marks are subject to the same return payment terms, which apply to the development loans granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in ten years of age in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that preserves it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Every transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which particular the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction contract can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services that are made or rendered in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization and who, according to the measure of what the caretaker has appointed at the time of loan granted, could be the beneficiary of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be withdrawn after its receipt as soon as possible from the caretaker to the Member State.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator notifies the EEC to the complete assignment of all the transaction's loans to the EEC on the purposes and programs approved by the directors in preparation for inspection by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction period, the caretaker informs the EWG quarterly on the development of the special transaction and the expenditures made therefor.</seg>
<seg id="755">The steward transfers the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with a statement by the external auditor of the organization to this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEC will send an extensive report on the projects and programs funded by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the transaction account, which are apparent from the accounts payable to the account and deposits paid out of the account and deposits on the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of thoughts about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction proposals and on any other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement entered into force on December 31, 1978 or at a later point in which the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is repaid and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC according to the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States notes the conclusion of their proceedings to the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretariat General conducts these notifications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement through the EEC to the organization.</seg>
