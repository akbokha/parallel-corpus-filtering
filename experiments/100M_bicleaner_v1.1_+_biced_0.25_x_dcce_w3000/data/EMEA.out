it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. adverti@@ se thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • bi@@ polar disorder , a mental disorder in which patients have man@@ ic episo@@ des ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal up@@ set ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des and to prevent man@@ ic episo@@ des in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to intake or the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swal@@ lo@@ wing tablets .
in patients taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably mainly known as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the recep@@ tors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the symptoms have already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was conducted in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients respon@@ ding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bed the processed tablets and the solution to take away .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episo@@ des in patients previously treated as plac@@ ebo for up to 74 weeks and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most frequent side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ ale disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , head@@ ache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ bili@@ fy benefits in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des in bi@@ polar disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episo@@ des , and in which the man@@ ic episo@@ des referred to the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episo@@ des in bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episo@@ des and their man@@ ic episo@@ des applied to the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day in an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ctor is removed from combination therapy , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the inci@@ dence of suicide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after switching from an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant forms ) .
3 late dy@@ sh@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , were occasional reports of dy@@ sc@@ an@@ tics occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
when patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sc@@ an@@ tics occur should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , have to be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes , Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes , Mell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other central drugs containing over@@ lying effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be carried out .
in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole results in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , have a similar effect and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be made .
after removal of the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be elevated to the height at the beginning of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ane / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ane ) .
patients should be advised to notify their physician when pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data security in humans and due to the concerns caused by the re@@ productive studies in the animal , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including autom@@ obil@@ es , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the inci@@ dence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , decreased overall inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was observed in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from o@@ el@@ zap@@ in therapy .
in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , and concerning their inci@@ dence also reported in the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and sei@@ zur@@ es , und@@ esi@@ red cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and Diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma connection .
it is thought that the effectiveness of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
in vit@@ ro Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine d@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , by the cau@@ dat@@ us nucle@@ us and the pl@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ ding patients treated in the study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an ob@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % was compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo in reducing some symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in the week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing the symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol observed a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol over a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ formulation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination bracket time is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ k@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the det@@ ri@@ ment of liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o aria , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ous potential , pre@@ clinical data did not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only for dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical applications .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level rin@@ der tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accum@@ ulations and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal @-@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ den car@@ cin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al rin@@ den aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of 1 to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

it is thought that the effectiveness of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
in an ob@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % was compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was compared to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ fold of average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control Agi@@ tier@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episo@@ des of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically installed , the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by det@@ ecting obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already applied to maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solutions in patients with Agi@@ tier@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episo@@ des of the bi@@ polar I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solutions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( through prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant forms ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , were occasional reports of dy@@ sc@@ an@@ tics occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to the after all@@ usion of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) were administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and at the same time received the lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , have a similar effect and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be made .
after removal of the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be elevated to the height at the beginning of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to the after all@@ uring of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the inci@@ dence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients was treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , and concerning their inci@@ dence also reported in the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and sei@@ zur@@ es , und@@ esi@@ red cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was compared with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of Agi@@ tier@@ eness / behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ tier@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement in the symptoms of plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with serious episo@@ des or patients with severe Agi@@ tier@@ ness , a similar activity was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 the proportion of respon@@ ding patients treated in the study medi@@ ation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( or@@ ally ) significantly improved the decline rate , which was 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % was compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing the symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 weeks study in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target body after repeated application in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cular .
studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 mal ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ous potential , pre@@ clinical data did not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical applications .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ adren@@ alin @-@ tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accum@@ ulations and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times of average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the middle indu@@ bit@@ al state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications .
only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer showed no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the CH@@ MP ) Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications , it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in Sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grad 3 , the treatment is to break until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for recomm@@ ending dose adaptation in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulated formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
patients should not be treated with renewed abra@@ sion cycles until neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic numbers rise again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic numbers is increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is clearly not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient @-@ collective are not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease .
in case the patient advoc@@ ates mal@@ ign@@ ant nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contra@@ c@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to witness no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised to have a sperm con@@ serving before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the per@@ spi@@ ration and ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the co@@ hesi@@ on of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital interval and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ inal protein SPAR@@ C ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two one @-@ one random@@ ised trials and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparison study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion of more than 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ plex trial was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes inf@@ usion ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a dist@@ ressed general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % of metastatic disease and 19 % of metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards b@@ ord on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or past@@ ing binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to an intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after 30 minutes of inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ an ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which blood trans@@ fusion might occur if there is no bleeding in the blood , and with which a blood loss can be expected from 900 to 1 800 ml .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to make sure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
after administration as an injection into a v@@ ein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference medicine .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the trial period between 25 and 29 .
in addition , the company presented the results of a study where the effects of the treated Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were ren@@ amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used for patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients ) .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union &apos;s provisions , it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG as a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing ana@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate ana@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in planned larger operative interventions , which demand a large blood volume set ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ f@@ usi@@ onal complications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of ana@@ emia and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease , therefore ass@@ essing the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding d@@ os@@ is@@ management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for ana@@ emia control and ana@@ emia .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 2.6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of ana@@ emia and follow @-@ up can be different depending on age , gender and overall disease , therefore ass@@ essing the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding d@@ os@@ is@@ management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control ana@@ emia .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ zahl &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl to the bas@@ eline value , an appeal to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operative intervention .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative intervention and the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg at 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient inj@@ ections of the drug into the circulation system .
patients who suffer from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ opy ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ opy ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous ro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
patients with an aut@@ olog@@ ous orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery are contra@@ indicated by epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , periph@@ eral arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ usion , v@@ ascular disease of the cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ ema ( PR@@ CA ) very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , the reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ous tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ wert , considering the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten &quot; Index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / mic@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin antibodies should be assessed and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit attributed to the combination of epo@@ e@@ ins , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control ana@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients taking chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ substanti@@ ated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 to keep the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger electrical orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , if possible , prior to beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger electro @-@ orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery should have an appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
moreover , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output foot value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival and reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels should be controlled by Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in dosage should be adjusted to the growing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
in vit@@ ro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF related to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
via thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al im@@ pregn@@ ation , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular inci@@ dents ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
irrespective of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood @-@ don@@ ating to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications .
the gene@@ tically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ zed and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ oc@@ ese .
389 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s Ly@@ mph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ blast@@ osis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ ma car@@ cin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 Mam@@ ma car@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ours , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with ha@@ em@@ atic blast@@ osis .
survival and progression @-@ progression were examined in five large @-@ controlled trials of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim to reach a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved following intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( not increased with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .

• If you suffer from an un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) within one month , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris ( for the first time , or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood @-@ dro@@ pping in the v@@ eins ( deep ven@@ ous ro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , if a blood cl@@ aw has occurred before you .
you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( periph@@ eral arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ usion ) , the throat vessels ( v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ enes ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it may result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which res@@ ides in further treatment .
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the start of the therapy .
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ inflammatory ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ enia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( sc@@ allo@@ ped under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ opy , it will break down your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of ana@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood cl@@ umping ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous ro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed seem like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor under certain circumstances .
if a major orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood drop@@ sy after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your ana@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to ensure treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ emia addresses the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to use Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .

eye li@@ ds and lips ( Quin@@ ce ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia means that there are no longer enough red blood cells to be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood @-@ pf@@ usion ( thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ pf@@ ishing after surgery ( post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) if your initial aid is too high

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones crack ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a trau@@ matic her@@ nia of hip frac@@ tures ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) oral or through inj@@ ections in a muscle before the first inf@@ usion .
administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedies against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and was compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ine of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to plac@@ ebo .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subjected to the risk of kidney disease , reactions at the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
A@@ cl@@ asta manufactures awareness material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in sed@@ entary women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side @-@ effects • When used for medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ opor@@ osis .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended for two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with the disease of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ause inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age , as data are missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
before starting the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ite is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of poly@@ chro@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ite can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with the disease of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate , with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental attacks , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
inci@@ dence of severe side effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was comparable between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which were associated as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were similar in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days after a gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the disease pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip fra@@ cture and in the disease pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip fra@@ cture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis vitamin D before administ@@ ering A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administ@@ ering Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the max@@ ill@@ ary area was used , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the max@@ ill@@ ary area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including fluor@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area in one with A@@ cl@@ asta and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ite , an equilibrium can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ usion 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years with either a bone den@@ omin@@ ator ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the scar@@ ring of ≤ -@@ 1,5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ difficult existing verteb@@ ral fra@@ cture or a BM@@ D T score for the scar@@ ring phase ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric rates of spine decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the inci@@ dence of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta reported a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip of 6.0 % , of the thig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic bone .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone structure compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ mot@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , the A@@ cl@@ eral treatment increased BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ eral treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall frag@@ ran@@ ces and by 4.3 % on the scar@@ ring .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all mild to moderate @-@ heavy mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.6 times age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of fluor@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain and pain influence compared to bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in an observ@@ ational phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ause and 107 patients treated with the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was er@@ ect at 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ause , compared to 71 of patients treated with the Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate will be maintained at an average period of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients resulted in the following phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma tor@@ ch quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a prolonged phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ased dis@@ appearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ zeit ton ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 4 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ metabol@@ ised inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function disorder to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adaptation of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ exist@@ ent intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was administered the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats , given doses of 0,6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 to 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in ec@@ umen@@ ical ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs including g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ one of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease pa@@ get of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by re @-@ norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / used or used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drink , you are worried that in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
the usual dose is 5 mg , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ asta is effective for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in the time after inf@@ usion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
when the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta exp@@ ires , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta Falls , if you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have obtained A@@ cl@@ asta .
physical signs of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or de@@ af feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent p@@ ains and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended to perform two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fra@@ cture .
before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ite can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with the disease of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more .
in addition , there were four studies of more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting up smoking .
in contrast to studies on the setting of the smoking , there were no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common A@@ Es of A@@ comp@@ lia observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants since it can increase the risk of depression , and among other things , a small minority of patients can cause suicide .
caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy used for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight cuts
medicine used in patients that require it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing treatment packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z
it supplements diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which moreover exhibit one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years on the basis of lack of data for efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported at up to 10 % , suicide rates for up to 1 % of patients receiving ri@@ der@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in cases of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
he also in patients who - besides the obesity - have no apparent risk , can cause depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby individuals ) are advised that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and to take immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ct or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of adverse outcomes that were not observed in clinical trials , but observed in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic field , were considered possibly relevant to the clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
it was given to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant for a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects on the fertility or cycle disturb@@ ances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development caused an exposure to the mat@@ ernal ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) that cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ onic res@@ ins or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ onic res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3,5 years .
the study measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg when applying doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional benefit from Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional capsule of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.0@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision problems , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high k@@ et@@ on@@ mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin to develop a compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is raised up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver cells are to be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , colon@@ ization , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver cells are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by the clinical assessment until the preliminary date of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from adi@@ pose zones and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the launch of the market , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indicators , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on the occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report faul@@ ts of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated intra@@ ocular inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medi@@ cin@@ ations .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medi@@ cin@@ ations .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter it , the treatment is to be reset ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with pharmaceuticals that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ctor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal age are less@@ ened , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from available data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as it is also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents were the same as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
since its launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active Study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medi@@ cin@@ ations .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years in order to study time to post the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment started , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ b@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin had been random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ ine / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics for 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol was observed as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ al@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels compared to plac@@ ebo , while met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either a pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo for a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the triple the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it demonstrated that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ctor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ ers were detected mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination season of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , in the treatment of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates is reduced for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) of the ureth@@ ra were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ dal Indi@@ ans resulted in an increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ cop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated intra@@ ocular inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medi@@ cin@@ ations .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medi@@ cin@@ ations .
in another study for more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were investigated .
clinical studies over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kl@@ es , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pan@@ cre@@ as no insulin can produce , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks showing how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were significantly lower compared to another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed from the package insert ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ cord in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , when a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should accordingly be advised .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ased , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient a dose adaptation is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin had reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before trips depar@@ ting over several time zones , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them .
4 If hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturb@@ ances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Gel@@ lich - Periph@@ er@@ als neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of the blood sugar control can be associated with dis@@ comfort , which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose settings may , however , be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration in di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the lower body tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An inj@@ ector can cause a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if om@@ itted to change inser@@ ts within the injection area .
local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur during insulin therapy .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
for this reason , di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape picking , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) , or through glucose , which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ p@@ tion@@ spro@@ fil lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ - ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molec@@ ule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites trained by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .

ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may also be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ cord pi@@ d across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of insulin &apos;s long acting insulin .
3 In case of change to ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the patient a dose adaptation is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before trips depar@@ ting over several time zones , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used for patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still g@@ out attacks , so it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ light drug ) and of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems were given only 100 mg a day .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history there may be also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present tox@@ in and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um resistance level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adol@@ escents , the application of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure treatment with Feb@@ vre ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ p @-@ like medicines , a acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment of the treatment , because the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ p pi@@ eg@@ els can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissues .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine occurs in rare cases as far as a storage in the ur@@ inary tract occurs .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ an ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the treatment phase and in the course of subsequent clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ war did not conduct any interaction studies on Feb@@ vre ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine levels ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in the Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ o@@ sta exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , slo@@ ws the absorption of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decline in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies leave no side effects from Feb@@ vre ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported by the Prü@@ far@@ in@@ ol in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extensions studies ( 1.4 vs. 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) observed , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found .
risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects , which could be performed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ vre ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ an treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term prolong@@ ation studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ vre ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ o@@ sta treatment groups and performed in patients who received 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the report occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short breath , skin irrit@@ ation , erectile dysfunction , rise in pot@@ assium concentration in the blood , increase in t@@ SH concentrations in the blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin Re@@ action cade → X@@ an@@ thin → Har@@ ns@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ vre ost@@ at is an effective non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month had specific ser@@ um levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um kre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional prescribed dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ p acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um ret@@ ina values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al functional restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney dys@@ functional restriction ( d . h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant difference in the percentage decline of ser@@ um ret@@ ard@@ ant concentrations in subjects , not@@ with@@ standing their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um atro@@ city concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( Bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in the open prolong@@ ation study of Phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction of the ser@@ um levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a ven@@ ge@@ ance ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not require treatment against a ven@@ ge@@ ance ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the no@@ d@@ ular no@@ d@@ ules , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ vre ost@@ at ( 5,0 % ) and also received patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term prolong@@ ation studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration simplified and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ vre ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in ser@@ um concentration concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The seem@@ ing Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres per intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma rotation of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bon@@ ding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites were mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ vre o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ vre ost@@ at , 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged February post@@ ulate ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
besides the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged February post@@ ulate ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the average overall AU@@ C of Feb@@ vre ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes in regard to AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility Bei male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ours ( intermediate cellular pap@@ ill@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly do@@ zed group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered non @-@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that Feb@@ vre ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction output of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were about 4 times of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity appeared , which was accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data that origin@@ ate from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data indicating that the Al@@ end@@ ron dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose required for preventing a loss of bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( paraly@@ sis ) , stir@@ ring abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic cl@@ umps .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should not be applied .
it may not be used for es@@ oph@@ agus diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the promotion of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following notes are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising up the day . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or dis@@ integrate the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ oc@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ oc@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ ign@@ ant frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lo@@ wing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worse heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regime contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the lowering of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ it@@ ative for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take the pill next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not easy to apply during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron leave no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ onate ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , decreased the ser@@ um calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar inci@@ dence .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , ec@@ op@@ i@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spinal column and con@@ com@@ ers continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the inci@@ dence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
absorption of reference to an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0,64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after night fast and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standar@@ dised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) showed no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous offering of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at amounted to 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys or alkal@@ ine transport system by rats and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .
in healthy adult men ( women and men ) after fast fasting and two hours before intake of a meal , the mean area under the ser@@ um concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous Vitamin D3 ) .
the mean maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5,@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ anz@@ ity until reaching maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is hydr@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1,25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 to healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the percentage of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly eliminated via urine .
although there are no clinical data on it , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in the bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .
non @-@ clinical data on the basis of conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ous potential do not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transplan@@ tation , comparing the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ intake of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f .

for patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines can be taken with Adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zes yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; No. 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ di@@ tions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a medical practi@@ tioner in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot; )
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ab should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
day 4 was the system@@ ic exposition , measured as a level of blood , comparable to both cases of kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the state of Ste@@ ady is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft gra@@ ft . oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Tran@@ sition from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must undergo a transplan@@ t recep@@ tor from twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in proportion of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin with the pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation in adult patients , who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , is an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once daily .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f at lun@@ ar , p@@ ank@@ re@@ ase and bo@@ wel @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 - 0.0@@ 15 mg / kg / day for patients with pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral Initi@@ al dosage of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for the maintenance of blood cells in the targeted field can be a reduction in the dose for patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required .
due to ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um canc@@ ers , a calculation of the cre@@ atine content and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switching from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood levels in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases involving thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ab controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whol@@ em@@ eal blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the t@@ onal level of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or excessive exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ di@@ tions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a degra@@ dation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical impact of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such conditions .
in rare cases , an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Progra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturb@@ ances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin alter@@ ations due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection agent with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and vision problems , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ated , l@@ act@@ ose , patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood parameters of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels in the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was used with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabol@@ isation .
high @-@ do@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rep@@ ul@@ sion reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is imp@@ aired .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increase hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , it is particularly careful with decisions about contra@@ cep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended to det@@ ri@@ mental effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cells .

overall , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ f developed in these published studies the observations in the large studies in which Progra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ centric trial with oral Progra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic Tran@@ splan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases in which Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the inci@@ dence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric trial with oral Progra@@ f was conducted in 205 patients who simultaneously received pan@@ cre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per Protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical findings of a mono@@ centric trial with oral Progra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tation showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a increase in metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via g@@ all .
the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f was nearly 10 % lower than in Progra@@ f in stable patients ( once a day ) in relation to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( mg : mg ) .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether adv@@ ancing is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tum with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
lawyers may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the promotion of advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosing The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not drop below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the passing speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
because of the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there is no experience of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s that appear in the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which had previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not ass@@ essments ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ OC inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ OC in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ y@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in any of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed he@@ y@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was established .
previously untreated patients in a current clinical trial formed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side @-@ effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were inter@@ mitt@@ ently reported on the inci@@ dence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , an allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) was reported in A@@ DV@@ OC .
the activated factor VIII acts as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activ@@ ated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ OC were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ OC in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits risk reduction as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every six months , has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected .
it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of yourself and thus no infections can trigger people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still un@@ answered .
based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not proven that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors could benefit patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP from taking the consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ escents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be passed on to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took the aer@@ os@@ ze were 4@@ 6,0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients in Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who alone took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id fever ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id fever ) , or a stroke of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company SP Europe for the marketing of aer@@ ators throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fail .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ ph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks of ending such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o con@@ stri@@ ctors , such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a s@@ wollen Rhin@@ ology ( Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients suffering from ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder retention or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce it to their extent .
as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so interaction with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to inci@@ dence in the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and because of the v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ ze in pregnancy should not be applied .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of the per@@ spi@@ ration or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a C@@ NS depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian dist@@ s .

a C@@ NS stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ ill@@ ary rigi@@ dity , and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a C@@ NS arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ os@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets , determined by the total body for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets with regard to the s@@ wollen effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
in the framework of a single dose survey on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of aer@@ os@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the fluid balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent after exposure to an aer@@ os@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination possessed no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in re@@ productive sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was evaluated in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies on patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rup@@ eds , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance during the day ) and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be taken according to the previous illness and can be res@@ umed after the symptoms of the symptoms and re@@ appear again .
in the pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be accepted that there may be an imp@@ air@@ ment of the per@@ spi@@ ration or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in several indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose survey with adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of questionn@@ aire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain resulting from seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology not@@ with@@ standing the ae@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
as the history of history is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not lead to an improvement in symptoms , except for chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the sleep and w@@ ak@@ age disturb@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patient demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so interaction with other medicines is not entirely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher proportion of substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of side effects in children aged between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ escents in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose survey of adults and adol@@ escents , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ ate dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ins in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adol@@ escents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents performed in clinical studies on no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of questionn@@ aire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively the resulting from seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ lizing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ duration of approximately 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those recommended by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is available in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ resistant poly@@ propylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ysty@@ rene measuring spo@@ on , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate is taken to be taken without dam@@ aging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in several indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose survey with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .

there are limited clinical trials of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without dam@@ aging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at for det@@ aching des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abo@@ lizing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) bigger than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population .
in single dose cross @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at for inclusion , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not investigated by pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , however , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose for children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze fully is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use this medicine with her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase deficiency .
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most frequent side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years was observed .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see below section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adol@@ escents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , depending on the duration of symptoms , may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and
as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of questionn@@ aire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively the strain resulting from seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .

since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration on Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio @-@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those recommended by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially shared the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
in adults and elderly people , A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to person because human beings have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
following the administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus , contained in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to make more antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recogni@@ zes as a foreign body ) , has been isolated , isolated and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the amount of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed only if the doctor has insp@@ ected which anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase after body weight is determined .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV amount in the blood when taking in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs and keeps it at a low level .
however , AIDS is not able to heal , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
the A@@ gener@@ ase medicine with low dose was compared to 206 adults who used prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors previously , compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also decreased viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generative may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited approved for the transport of agro@@ chemicals throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
as usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , which contain Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
as usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the related specialist information of these medicines .
patients with reduced h@@ epatitis function including chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including ra@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are even lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ half of the A@@ generic ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections may develop , leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medi@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised predominantly via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient records Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel are and , if possible , to check the virus load and susp@@ end the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut .
dose adaptation for one of the drugs is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % degra@@ ded when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ night @-@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ o@@ k@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of aden@@ os@@ ene in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in was performed , however , due to the ant@@ azi@@ de component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and aden@@ os@@ ene lies at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adaptation is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine &apos;s effect on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , care must be advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar .
if these drugs are used together , care is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , since an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in adverse events associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneously using Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interaction together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme predi@@ ctors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen them with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with related side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma levels at simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ level increases in these H@@ MG Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am at the same time as using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are even lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the minor reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at this time , as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adapted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in con@@ current offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predict@@ able , therefore alternative methods of contra@@ c@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. D@@ esi@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother as compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ act@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ ision in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding times , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the as@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , and went up early and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators than in connection with the study medi@@ ation and were recorded in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300 study , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients , which received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception formed elev@@ ations of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were treated very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures must be initiated .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ate stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ bub@@ ble cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r men@@ stru@@ ed treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 71@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic detection systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic detection systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a reduced lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to evaluate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ator points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients not pre@@ treated patients , in which an amp@@ ren@@ etic retin@@ opathy ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
in contrast , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which adults treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and thirty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 sub @-@ study .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ margin of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was not a low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account in PI pre@@ treated children to the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
this means that medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the capsule of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be minor .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma con@@ es comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ o@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rats ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes contained , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ eton changes have been observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ night @-@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , care is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , since an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in con@@ current offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother as compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ ision in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding times , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures must be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both on ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ bub@@ ble cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.0@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
in contrast , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
this means that medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele A@@ den@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . )
A@@ generic solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not covered with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ generic ase solution for intake and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is performed five times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of inter@@ mission between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected skin areas before bed@@ time so that it remains sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were either daily or five times a week .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to 505 patients with n@@ ude ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . in the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the plac@@ ebo group compared to 0 % to 3 % .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme can be continued until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ ular area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ der the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme is to apply in a thin layer and apply in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ ns infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ acy was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with a tendency leading to circumc@@ ision .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream to higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in ur@@ ging ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous agents for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ ular area have not yet been clinical experience .
limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient population in relation to the elimination of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions are after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data available for long term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of chronic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the sc@@ alp .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions are causing great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating qualities , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

although neither after one @-@ time nor after repeated top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were reached , no recommendation can be applied during lac@@ tation .
the most frequently shared and probably with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side @-@ effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of the fung@@ i ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the associated side @-@ effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ al@@ om patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the side effect , were in these studies a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects , which were given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme often occur to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan proposed evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ them@@ atic subjects ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe atro@@ phy and carbon@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of act@@ ose ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was established with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental or@@ ale intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated in accordance with the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the fung@@ i during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients the genital war@@ ts healed completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 79.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this could remain for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a connected 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the untreated sc@@ alp or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical follow @-@ up after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indic@@ ative fung@@ i , n@@ ude ker@@ at@@ ose and super @-@ fi@@ ci@@ y bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in the ser@@ um at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the sc@@ alp ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ duration after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ ably bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal tox@@ icity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight ; a study carried out for four months on the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mal@@ ign@@ ant administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R .

a low number of blood cells can cause you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to get a blue stain from you sooner or she can evo@@ ke de@@ position .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this usage information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas that you have applied to al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
it usually involves lighter skin reactions that res@@ end within 2 weeks after setting the treatment .
occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , atro@@ phy , skin tz@@ stab , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes at the application location ( blood , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , irrit@@ ation , or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , eye irrit@@ ation , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , ul@@ c@@ ers , limbs , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of MP@@ S I can occur : increased liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lo@@ wered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement parameter of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who are possibly highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ mon@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed , and if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in individual steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect nearly all patients to form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ mon@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be carefully prec@@ eded .
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered to be considered .
the inf@@ usion can be re@@ absorbed by reducing the inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular reception of lar@@ mon@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been exposed to breast milk over the breast milk is recommended , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe prescription and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ium within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , and the patients at the age of 5 were compared to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ium ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients no antibodies were detected by radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ ul@@ c@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients with whom there was never a trial version .
patients with lacking to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ des .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vit@@ ro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to stand in connection with inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ v@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely via man@@ tis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond to patients treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decline in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks there was a clear decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients , which were taken into account by using a combined End@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant change spann@@ ed across five efficacy end@@ points ( expected percentage of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe form of circulation and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased Gag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . younger patients with the severe delay form had a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe delay form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available each year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less strongly affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a unique gift , tox@@ icity in repeated administration and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data does not recognize any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6.@@ 6. .

this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural pro@@ pul@@ sion of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from MP@@ S I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase activ@@ ates certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is absent altogether .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because it is possible to risk a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( inci@@ dence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • r@@ ash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ dening • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • response to the inf@@ usion device
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , evaluate each year , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens than any therapy .
to reduce side @-@ effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should also be given before or after the application of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , depos@@ ited or decreases the dose .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells sharing .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin exceeded an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta had longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ weight plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with a combination of Lo@@ - cally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
for reduction of inci@@ dence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake should be continued throughout the therapy duration as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mcg ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each dose , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking the awareness of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood@@ stream or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 ble@@ edings .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the treatment must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that at the age of 65 year@@ - or more in comparison to patients at the age of 65 years an increased side @-@ side risk exists .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended to all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver dys@@ functional restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row supp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ atic value has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was considered if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be ordered to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid simultaneous consumption of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ lin@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ duration for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be induced in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , men should be advised against the treatment - G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .

since no data is available for the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with decent an@@ tim@@ el@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except if strictly required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm cell viewing .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in breast@@ feeding inf@@ ants cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was demonstrated in the use of the Lun@@ - gen@@ canc@@ er@@ sympt@@ om@@ sk@@ ala in ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common cis@@ pl@@ a arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ centric , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there are not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitive to the ingredient or any of the ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or low @-@ fat diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can go with improved met@@ abolic control patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant contra@@ cep@@ tive measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ tions in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a decrease of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in plasma was observed in a study on the interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials for up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time were observed a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of taken fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not ass@@ essments ) .
the inci@@ dence of known side effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some extent .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to alle@@ g@@ ations with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick recovery of the system@@ ic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the matching properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is carried out in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ical and p@@ ank@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ties .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( starting value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after the oral dosage of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be found spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , the minimal system@@ ically absorb@@ able dose was administered , two main met@@ abolic metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plas@@ ma@@ sis concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , can@@ ter@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproduction tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data does not pose a special threat to humans .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts , as at that time you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional conditions : • Beg@@ in already several days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount ev@@ enly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat main dish or a stap@@ le diet , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , they learn to control over time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not use all@@ i after the expi@@ ration date specified on the board . • Do not store any excess of 25 ° C . • The container ti@@ ghtly closed to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed container with si@@ licate gel that serves to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is attached to this pack .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • Ad@@ diction • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ jou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the effect of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutrition @-@ related companion phenomena . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 These decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0,5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you work little or not daily , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 kcal per day , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep them in . • Sinn@@ fully a nutritional journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fet@@ al scent and give guidelines to become physically active .

Alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy , the strong cause of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there are not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company of Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy alone due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in case of a simultaneous dispens@@ ing of p@@ allet os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or if the Q@@ t interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or may tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a must be used for prevention and treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was not inhibit@@ ing the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents directed against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 indu@@ ctors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ met@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing testimon@@ ies .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar inci@@ dents showed similar inci@@ dence of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 mac@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials to treat chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of p@@ alle@@ ti@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the potential of action .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of the EC@@ G @-@ based Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous application follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ duration of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional throughout the whole dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) increased in 11 tes@@ ticle @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients with 42 ± 34 % of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration .
phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with that after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the penetration of 0.75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated via the kid@@ neys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous wound injection in healthy patients , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ ver@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre@@ clinical studies effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was roughly twice the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ ro@@ id gland , pit@@ u@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al gl@@ ands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and because Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is neg@@ li@@ gible for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative opinion in which the approval for the marketing of the drugs prescribed for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended for the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination the liver tissue has damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are ab@@ normal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon found data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicine to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the CH@@ MP opinion poll@@ ing the approval for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns were expressed in the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of h@@ epatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease was fl@@ amed up in more patients than in the reference medicine ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study to examine the question , to what extent the medicine is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ z@@ ations , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against this kind of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ utter@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together by skin @-@ dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and consider an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
retin@@ opathy is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials involving secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 @-@ 3 days treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of retin@@ opathy and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached by humans after top@@ ical application on poor skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adaptation is not considered necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement about the birth and f@@ ö@@ ra@@ cial / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / stop or stop the therapy with an al@@ tar@@ go should be continued between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the date of the appointment that approximately 1 % of patients were concerned .
mode of action , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ lei@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacter@@ i@@ ological ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer Center .
binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partially P @-@ Bin@@ ding Inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance appear to apply the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of retin@@ opathy vis @-@ à @-@ vis S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were found regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ respon@@ ding to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of man after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ red@@ ded skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with minor involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vit@@ ro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) :
in an embry@@ onic ox@@ icity study of rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ icity ( decreased body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ine consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be completed from two doses .
if a tracking dose is desirable against h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis B or B vacc@@ ine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults contain identical ingredients , some of the data used to support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ur@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission awarded Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire company
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a h@@ epatitis vacc@@ ination require a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , the chances of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vacc@@ ine .
if a rapid protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme is recommended using the combination vacc@@ ine containing 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibody , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ inations may be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ air@@ ment in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in these cases , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ mus@@ cular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ism , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the inci@@ dence observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ al and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 ino@@ cul@@ ation doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to including 15 years .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy based on a calculation based per vacc@@ ination dose , but not based on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects that Ambi@@ rix had given had been reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of dex@@ ter@@ ity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. throughout the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of subjects that Ambi@@ rix got , compared with 36.@@ 2 % in subjects that received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) .
the frequency of pronounced sor@@ eness and accuracy was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the inci@@ dence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ine h@@ epatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme using Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , a month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12 - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three doses .
for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B were significantly higher in month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ine h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ ha@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ Bs could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was similar to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12 - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ Bs antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the refres@@ h vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of present form@@ ulations in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing per eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory that is authorised for this purpose .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ e@@ water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blonde face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against infection with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B virus before administ@@ ering both vacc@@ inations ( even though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to am@@ bition or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) in your child / child .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , res@@ pi@@ ration or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ine ) .
at a possible risk of h@@ epatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis B / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form @-@ in@@ in@@ ated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination prior to the termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / or has received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
it may however be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given enough , unless it is imper@@ ative that they are vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request tell your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ vacc@@ inated cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ching • Rei@@ z@@ ability • Head@@ ache • App@@ e@@ tit@@ lack
♦ Normal ( up to 1 case per 10 ed@@ ged C@@ ans ) : • swelling at the injection place • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders
further side effects that have been reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 inj@@ ected doses ) are :

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ing the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has been placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gast@@ rom@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ ola could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ light medication , i.e. without drug ) .
am@@ mon@@ ial can also result in loss of appetite , ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , flavor disorders or taste release , abdominal pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ia in patients with interfer@@ ences of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents am@@ mon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest@@ o form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect manifest@@ ing after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use , if a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules form .
daily dose is individually calculated according to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adol@@ escents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest@@ o deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ scar@@ is , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders as there is a risk for the gen@@ esis of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is performed over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , the ne@@ ural increase was slo@@ wed down and a disturbed loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ do@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dial , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound that is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for every gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the inci@@ dence of the first symptoms in the new@@ born was almost always inf@@ licted , and the disease itself resulted in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life .
hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post @-@ part@@ um ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many people with intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
patients with a late manifest@@ o form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , treated by hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kid@@ neys enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were established .
following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted in 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken oral ( babies and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest@@ o deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ scar@@ is , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contain 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ pipes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth , l@@ esi@@ ons in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain c@@ ort@@ ex came into l@@ esi@@ ons .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ do@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dial , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ules form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were established .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to obtain the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the intake of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS since the medicine can go to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste disturb@@ ances , dis@@ appointment of hearing , dis@@ oriented disturb@@ ance , memory failure and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you find any of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , nau@@ sea , ob@@ struction , unpleasant skin odor , r@@ ash , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain , and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this usage information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may no longer use AM@@ MONA@@ PS according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eable until &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ ration date on the paper@@ board and container . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and content of the pack AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are emb@@ ell@@ ished with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 When laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS to the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op Gran@@ ul@@ at . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the edge of the measuring spo@@ on to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spo@@ on is equivalent to a measuring spo@@ on .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of an@@ ox@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients with a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ira , other mil@@ ins or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union by The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us addition of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the surgery , an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is supposed to be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and efficacy of an allergy form of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the inci@@ dence of lower ACT values , the re@@ conditioned and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intra@@ ven@@ ously intra@@ ven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney dys@@ functions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira udi@@ n against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis check again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al injury , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 days 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous formulation of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• Well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disturb@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ valent is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though most of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI @-@ patients , most bleeding disorders can occur in patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent udi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira again reaches the level existing before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ valent udi@@ n with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic aggregate numbers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in each case are regularly monitored .
the animal experiments are in@@ adequate for the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira , plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 603 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in both the bi@@ valent group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more pre@@ valent than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding , as defined in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups of He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the pun@@ cture zone , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduced hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , using blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occ@@ ured at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; mis@@ c &quot; positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI study .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more pre@@ valent than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less in bi@@ valent studies than in the comparative group of He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ@@ classes .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ valent udi@@ n is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ valent udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or t@@ inn@@ ed .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ira udi@@ n was unable to indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adol@@ escents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h , or the upper arm , or administered as a continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter working time than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in the comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ses .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , thig@@ h or del@@ ta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the abdom@@ en area .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( regul@@ ator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , inc@@ and@@ escence , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may make a change of the dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the insulin that is used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme .
substances that can increase blood glucose activity and increase bias to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ y@@ pyramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ balance can be weak@@ ened or missing under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ sis such as bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ ckers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin .
experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity did not show any differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
insulin is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters human breast milk , but insulin is generally not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed according to oral use .
listed below are the und@@ esi@@ rable agents known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ categories and arranged according to decre@@ asing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is lined to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or treated by a doctor with intra@@ ven@@ ous glucose .
after a glu@@ cos@@ ur injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episo@@ des .
insulin lo@@ wers blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs more quickly and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ um , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a propor@@ tion@@ ale glu@@ cos@@ ine effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a propor@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin analog .
from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before meal .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was harv@@ ested 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 hours before meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - 30 mins ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ nour@@ ished , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
