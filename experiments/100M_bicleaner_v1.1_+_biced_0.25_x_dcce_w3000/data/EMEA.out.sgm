<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. advertise thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • bipolar disorder, a mental disorder in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anormal upset) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to intake or the smelting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly known as "partial Agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the symptoms have already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was conducted in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbed the processed tablets and the solution to take away.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in patients previously treated as placebo for up to 74 weeks and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most frequent side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), Tremor (trembling), headache, blurred vision, somnolence (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Abilify benefits in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes referred to the treatment with aripiprazole, were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution for rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes applied to the treatment with aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day in an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the aripiprazol should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The incidence of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after switching from an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant forms).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyshinesia: clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, were occasional reports of dyscantics occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treated with Abilify, signs and symptoms of a late dyscantics occur should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, have to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events associated with aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagia, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes, Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes, Mellitus, should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central drugs containing overlying effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased AUC from Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers, the common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole results in comparison with CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, have a similar effect and therefore similar dose-reduction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After removal of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be elevated to the height at the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethane / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethane).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their physician when pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data security in humans and due to the concerns caused by the reproductive studies in the animal, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including automobiles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, decreased overall incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was observed in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from oelzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects that may occur in connection with antipsychotic treatment, and concerning their incidence also reported in the treatment with aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinetry and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Unintentional or intentional acute overdoses with aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis with aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HTA and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine d4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligands, by the caudatus nucleus and the plamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of responding patients treated in the study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- DepressionsRate Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oblanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7% was compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy against placebo in reducing some symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the week 12 Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing the symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients with Aripiprazol observed a remission with Aripiprazol over a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazol showed superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyylation of aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyformulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination bracket time is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics has no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the detriment of liver function to the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and Dehydro aria, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the cannulous potential, preclinical data did not recognize any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical applications.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-level rinder toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulations and / or parenchymal-cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for humans) and an increase of adrenal rinden carcinomas and combined adrenal rinden adenomas / carcinomas at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazole in bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose of 1 to 3fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole are no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11times of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already applied to maintenance or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazol, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of aripiprazole injection solutions in patients with Agitierness and behavioural disturbances, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the aripiprazole injection solution is considered necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on safety and efficacy of aripiprazole injection solutions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (through prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant forms).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, were occasional reports of dyscantics occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsie, polyphagia, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect resp. an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the after allusion of aripiprazole, in a study where the healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were administered intramuscularly and at the same time received the lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- Proteaseinhibitors, have a similar effect and therefore similar dose-reduction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After removal of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be elevated to the height at the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the after alluring of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients was treated with aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may occur in connection with antipsychotic treatment, and concerning their incidence also reported in the treatment with aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinetry and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders the aripiprazol injection solution was compared with statistically significant improvements of Agitiereness / behavioural disturbances compared with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as Agitierness and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant greater improvement in the symptoms of placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with serious episodes or patients with severe Agitierness, a similar activity was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 the proportion of responding patients treated in the study mediation was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg DepressionsRate Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (orally) significantly improved the decline rate, which was 34% in the aripiprazol (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7% was compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing the symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 weeks study in manic patients treated with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomization, Aripiprazol showed superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The aripiprazol AUC is 90% bigger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC after giving the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target body after repeated application in a systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application showed no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 mal (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the cannulous potential, preclinical data did not recognize any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical applications.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent non-adrenalin-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulations and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3-10 times of average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazole in bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose of 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-times of the middle indubital state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>
<seg id="191">Pharmacovigilance system The regulatory holders need to ensure that before and while the product is marketed, the pharmacovigilance system, as described in version 1.0 of module 1.8.1. of the authorisation application, is set up and functioning.</seg>

<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel medications.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, elevated blood sugar in the blood, elevated blood sugar, elevated phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stool, edematagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, orale pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, headaches, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active ingredient that promotes the cohesion of the microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interval and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendotheliale transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and occurs due to the albuminal protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two one-one randomised trials and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of more than 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multiplex trial was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes infusion (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a distressed general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% of metastatic disease and 19% of metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathic grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy towards bord on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous dosage of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume refers to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or pasting binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane dose (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">The published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After 30 minutes of infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in people with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urean excretion was 4% of the total dose of the total dose with less than 1% of the total metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which blood transfusion might occur if there is no bleeding in the blood, and with which a blood loss can be expected from 900 to 1 800 ml.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received an appropriate instruction.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to make sure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not sufficiently address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">After administration as an injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, compared with the reference medicine.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicative of the efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the trial period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company presented the results of a study where the effects of the treated Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were renamed to Abseamed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be used for patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients).</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Human Use Committee (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union's provisions, it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which manufactures Abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG as a permit for the marketing of Abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in planned larger operative interventions, which demand a large blood volume set (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusional complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms can vary depending on age, gender and overall disease, therefore assessing the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dosismanagement should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for anaemia control and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 2.6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and follow-up can be different depending on age, gender and overall disease, therefore assessing the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dosismanagement should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reaction rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulozytenzahl &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reaction rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reaction rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl to the baseline value, an appeal to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, Abseamed should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operative intervention.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation programme - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the operative intervention and the day of the surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg at 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injections of the drug into the circulation system.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with some erythropoetin on an erythroblastocopy (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a Abseamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastocopy).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous romboses (e.g. anamnestically well-known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">Patients with an autologous orthopaedic surgery are contraindicated by epoetin alfa: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastema (PRCA) very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropotin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, the reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions should be determined and the usual causes of non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminous toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulozytenwert, considering the anemia (i.e. the Retikulozyten "Index"), is reduced (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0,5%), the thrombolic and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropotin antibodies should be assessed and an investigation of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit attributed to the combination of epoeins, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control anaemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rise should be approximately 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients taking chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropotin response (patients who need to be transsubstantiated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 to keep the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a larger electrical orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to beginning of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger electro-orthopedic surgery should have an appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of osteoarthritis and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output foot value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival and reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, if a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">Epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels should be controlled by Ciclosporin and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adjusted to the growing hematokrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF related to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Via thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial impregnation, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (brain hemorrhage, cerebral infarction), arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from erythropotin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular incidents (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients suffering from erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Irrespective of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood-donating to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycosized and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropotin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indikator for the efficacy was whether the saline of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without osteoporosis treatment), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zinc hydrochloric acid or other bisphosphates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subjected to the risk of kidney disease, reactions at the infusion point and osteonecsis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta manufactures awareness material for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for osteoporosis treatment, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the disease Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with the disease of Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently acquired low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclause infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after using Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data are missing for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before starting the treatment with Aclasta, a pre-existing hypokalite is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid settling of the effect of polychroic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalite can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with the disease of Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonate, with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental attacks, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonate reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after using Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Kidney dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunctions, which were associated as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were similar in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after a gift was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial, compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the disease paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the disease paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an Initialdosis vitamin D before administering Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administering Zoledroneic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosen in the maxillary area was used, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosen (primary in the maxillary area), which were treated with bisphosphonate, including fluoric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental attacks.</seg>

<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric rates of spine decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the incidence of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrate fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta reported a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduction of 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip of 6.0%, of the thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology With 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third dose of bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic bone.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone structure compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Promottide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in the serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Acleral treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Acleral treatment led to an increase in BMD over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% on the overall fragrances and by 4.3% on the scarring.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly administration of Alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget des Knochens Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radiologically confirmed, above all mild to moderate-heavy morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6fold to 3.6 times age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of fluoric acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain and pain influence compared to baseline value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a responder at the end of the six-month trial could be included in an observational phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclause and 107 patients treated with the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was erect at 141 of the patients treated with Aclause, compared to 71 of patients treated with the Risedronate will be maintained at an average period of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledroneic acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmakokinetic data, which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma torch quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a prolonged phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biased disappearance from the large circulation system with half-life t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationshalbswertszeit ton ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ values) represent the fast resorption in bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose 5.4 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of substances metabolized by cytochrome-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because coledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, non-metabolised inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronylic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an even kidney function disorder to a creatinin-clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adaptation of the oledronylic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-existent intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application was administered the renal tolerability of Zoledroneic acid in rats, given doses of 0,6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2 to 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in ecumenical expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphone of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a result which reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients), in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl harnant or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonic resins or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphonic resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3,5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The study measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg when applying doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional benefit from Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resins decreased by 0.94%, while the additional capsule of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.069% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision problems, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketonmirrors - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin to develop a compensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is raised up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver cells are to be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, colonization, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver cells are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be guided by the clinical assessment until the preliminary date of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from adipose zones and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia is the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, the treatment with thiazolidindicators, including pioglitazone, was reported on the occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report faults of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological clarification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated intraocular incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medicinations.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medicinations.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter it, the treatment is to be reset (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment of pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternal age are lessened, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as it is also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents were the same as placebo, but more rarely than in placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive Study period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medicinations.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for two years in order to study time to post the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment started, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazon at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under glibazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin had been randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the albumine / creatine quotients compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol was observed as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid reduced overall plasmatalglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, while metformin and gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride level.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either a pioglitazone or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the triple the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it demonstrated that pioglitazon does not exercise any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the markers were detected mainly in the case (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination season of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, in the treatment of pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of metabolic substrates is reduced for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidences of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the urethra were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazoldal Indians resulted in an increased frequency of colonoscopes.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medicinations.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with pioglitazone or gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical studies over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary vascularization and vascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the intake of pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There was no clinically significant difference in the percentage decline of serum retardant concentrations in subjects, notwithstanding their renal function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum atrocity concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (Baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in the open prolongation study of Phase 3 showed that the long-term reduction of the serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of the patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment against a vengeance (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not require treatment against a vengeance).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the nodular nodules, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5,5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with Febvre ostat (5,0%) and also received patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term prolongation studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration simplified and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febvre ostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.6 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum concentration concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febvre ostat, 49% of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged February postulate (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (30%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">Besides the excretion of the urine, about 45% of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged February postulate (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active ingredient (1%), the well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average overall AUC of Febvre ostat took about the 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, malocophageal ulcera and malocophageal erosions, rarely followed by malignant fractures, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worse heartburn, and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malignant side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate malignant irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical trials with Alendron no increased risk was detected, rare (after market launch) Mag- and Duodenalulzera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair alendronate if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Studies with Alendronate The therapeutic equation of Alendronate once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and Alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multi-core study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of Alendronat on bone mass and fractures in postmenopausal women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in the Fraktur-Interventions- Study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with renal transplantation, comparing the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograf or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main Indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment period of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a re-intake of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were performed and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a medical practitioner in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talab should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 was the systemic exposition, measured as a level of blood, comparable to both cases of kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of Tacrolimus Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas may take several days until the state of Steady is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, the immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft graft. oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be required, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Transition from Prograf to Advagraf must undergo a transplant receptor from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in proportion of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the whole daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral Initialdosis recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin with the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation in adult patients, who are converted to Advagraf, is an oral initialdosis of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf at lunar, pankrease and bowel-transplanted patients, occurred in an oral Initial dose of 0.2 - 0.015 mg / kg / day for patients with pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral Initial dosage of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for the maintenance of blood cells in the targeted field can be a reduction in the dose for patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cancers, a calculation of the creatine content and monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood levels in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases involving thoroughbred Tacrolimus-Talab controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of Tacrolimus Talks during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talks of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances which could change the Tacrolimus wholemeal blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tonal level of Tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of Tacrolimus sub- or excessive exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the tight control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressive agents, there are no clinical data for the retardated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood, there are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a degradation of the tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical impact of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing the Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, an aqueous or septum hypertrophy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin alterations due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and vision problems, a radiological examination (e.g.)</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retardated, lactose, patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption are special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus increase or lower the blood parameters of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels in the simultaneous dispensing of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was used with antimycotics like ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted primarily from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dozed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute repulsion reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly careful with decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not provide evidence that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressive agents, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended to detrimental effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrites and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a increase in metabolism induced by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via gall.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advancing is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for preventing bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hammophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septum with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII, directed by IgG immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic-known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lower) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to assess the benefits risk reduction as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every six months, has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of yourself and thus no infections can trigger people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, formed from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body, usually contributes to recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, where Li-Fraumeni cancer appeared in the area of the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not proven that the injections of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors could benefit patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP from taking the consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen, inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be passed on to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms besides the constipation of the nose, the patients who took the aerosze were 46,0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients in Aerinaze showed an alleviation of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who alone took the desloratine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active substances or loratadine (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hyperthyroid fever), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid fever), or a stroke of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company SP Europe for the marketing of aerators throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fail.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term application can decrease the activity of Pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudophedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks of ending such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vaso constrictors, such as bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, the peroral or nasal as a swollen Rhinology (Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment of hypertension or tachycardia or tachycardia, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients suffering from arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder retention or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce it to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interaction with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to incidence in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and because of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosze in pregnancy should not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness, which may result in impairment of the perspiration or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a ZNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible Latvian dists.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, complicated mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vominess, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disorders and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially probable in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (oral dryness, pupillary rigidity, and dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerosze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerosze tablets, determined by the total body for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosze tablets with regard to the swollen effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerosze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the framework of a single dose survey on the pharmacokinetic of aerosze, desloratine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the fluid balance of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects Desloratadine were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) from Pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent after exposure to an aerosze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadine do not recognize any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive stoxicological studies the combination of loratadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and dropping or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed with you under the application of aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart chase, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmia • nausea and headache or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When applied in the recommended dosage, the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerosze leads to the dizziness or the attention diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerosze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerosze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the intake of aerosene, if you have forgotten to take a dose on time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you significantly impairs or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this usage information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chase, restlessness with increased physical activity, mouth drying, swindle, throat pain, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of desloratadine very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulty, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach problems, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml-solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was evaluated in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrupeds, impairment of sleep and performance during the day) and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the smelting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in urticaria, the decrease in symptoms after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persist allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratine in young people from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be taken according to the previous illness and can be resumed after the symptoms of the symptoms and reappear again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persist allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), patients may be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadine tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically-pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be accepted that there may be an impairment of the perspiration or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in several indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, in which up to 45 mg desloratadine (nine-fold clinical dosage) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses, in the desloratine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study where the desloratine was administered at a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose survey with adults Desloratadine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persist allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall cores of questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain resulting from seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology notwithstanding the aetiology in the different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the history of history is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin does not lead to an improvement in symptoms, except for chronic idiopathic urticaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of spindles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the sleep and wakage disturbance, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patient demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant accumulation after a daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interaction with other medicines is not entirely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially shared the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the marketing of Aflunov for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">In adults and elderly people, Aflunov should be used to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to person because human beings have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following the administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus, contained in the vaccine as "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to make more antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), has been isolated, isolated and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the amount of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which is caused by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution to take, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should be prescribed only if the doctor has inspected which antiviral drug the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase after body weight is determined.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases the HIV amount in the blood when taking in combination with other antiviral drugs and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS is not able to heal, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenerase medicine with low dose was compared to 206 adults who used proteasinhibitors previously, compared with other proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indikator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with unproven levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also decreased viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults treated earlier with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenera combined with Ritonavir to strengthen the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerative may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are degraded as well as Agenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of a lipodystrophy (alterations in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecrosis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously not taken protease inhibitors have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "" "" "in October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Limited approved for the transport of agrochemicals throughout the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As usual, Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosting of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcement of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, which contain Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">As usual, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the related specialist information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with reduced hepatitis function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myopathies including rahabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Standardization Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if there are even lower doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylenglycolgehalf of the Ageneric ase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may develop, leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 mediates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolised predominantly via CYP2D6 and are linked to the increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be degraded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient records Johanniskraut, the Amprenavirspiegel are and, if possible, to check the virus load and suspend the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dose adaptation for one of the drugs is not necessary when nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, compared to CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily used to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg knight-avir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a tight monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study for the use of adenosene in combination with Didanosin was performed, however, due to the antazide component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenue of didanosin and adenosene lies at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaptation is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Nevirapine's effect on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, care must be advised as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma bar.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, care is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, since an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavrdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dispensation of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in adverse events associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneously using Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may cause interaction together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva, known as enzyme predictors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and Verapamil may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen them with PDE5 inhibitors associated with related side-effects including hypotension, vision disorders and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% account interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensing of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma levels at simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases in these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhubyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">The plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the same time as amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3), while using parenteral midazolam at the same time as using parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level from Midazolam to the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if there are even lower doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the minor reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at this time, as the Amprenavir dose is to be adapted if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In concurrent offering of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Standardization Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother as compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, Amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the incision in the uterus to the end of breastfeeding times, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother-animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the asgenerase treatment were mild to moderate, and went up early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are used in connection with the use of Agenerase or another medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators than in connection with the study mediation and were recorded in more than 1% of patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fast subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominals and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pretreated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 300 study, 245 NRTIs performed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecsis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients, which received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dosified ritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception formed elevations of triglyceride and CPK values, which were treated very frequently in patients who received Agenerase together with low dozed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is observed on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures must be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral and gag-pol- polyproteinate stages with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acutely and chronically infected lymphobubble cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir menstrued treatment schemes with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pretreated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following proteasinhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic detection systems based on genotypic detection systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, M36I, I54A / L / M / S / T / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to evaluate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (separator points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral patients not pretreated patients, in which an amprenetic retinopathy (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In contrast, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that may adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which adults treated with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and thirty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017 sub-study.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the time-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-margin of 0.4 lo10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was not a low dose of ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, therapy optimisation should be taken into account in PI pretreated children to the expected benefit of "unbiased" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, compared to CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Amprenavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not investigated for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of chronic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use purpose, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take off in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating qualities, Imiquimod should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fecropracial development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after one-time nor after repeated topical application quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were reached, no recommendation can be applied during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and probably with the application of Imiquimod cream in related side-effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of the fungi (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the associated side-effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalom patients treated with imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side-effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with the side effect, were in these studies a reaction at the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects, which were given by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of Phase III with Imiquimod-Creme treated patients with actinic keratose, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with three-week treatment with Imiquimod-Creme often occur to local skin reactions including Erythem (30%), excreoriation / leaves / shed (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan proposed evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often resulted in severe erythematic subjects (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe atrophy and carbonation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actose keratosis, alopecia was established with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental orale intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were demonstrated in accordance with the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the fungi during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total 119 with Imiquimod patients the genital warts healed completely; this was 20% of the 105 patients with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-time use per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this could remain for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a connected 25 cm2 large treatment area on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical follow-up after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indicative fungi, nude keratose and super-ficiy basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod has not been shown in these studies at the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2hour half-duration after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superfiably basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight; a study carried out for four months on the dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with malignant administration on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area during sexual intercourse, the treatment with Aldara cream is after sexual intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or recently applied even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of fungi, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin spot with the pasta warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with feigns under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area beneath it (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A low number of blood cells can cause you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to get a blue stain from you sooner or she can evoke deposition.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you significantly impairs or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this usage information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas that you have applied to aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">It usually involves lighter skin reactions that resend within 2 weeks after setting the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, atrophy, skin tzstab, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes at the application location (blood, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, irritation, or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, throat pain, diarrhea, ulcers, limbs, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme prophylactic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, the movements difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitational equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by examining its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement parameter of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who are possibly highly hypersensitive (allergic) to larmonidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed, and if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by means of recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, every 15 minutes in individual steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been established, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalization facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect nearly all patients to form IgG antibodies against larmonidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be carefully preceded.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyreagents) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be reabsorbed by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular reception of larmonidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that have been exposed to breast milk over the breast milk is recommended, it is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years of age (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe prescription and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dosage), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a seroconium within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, and the patients at the age of 5 were compared to a seroconium (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) in 13 / 45 patients no antibodies were detected by radioimmunophulcitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom there was never a trial version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody tides.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to stand in connection with incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, larvonidase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mantis-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond to patients treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased further proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">The 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks there was a clear decrease of the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestations between the patients, which were taken into account by using a combined Endpoint, the clinically significant change spanned across five efficacy endpoints (expected percentage of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the severe form of circulation and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group. younger patients with the severe delay form had a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe delay form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dosage), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available each year, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used for patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regimens than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side-effects, patients should take corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "antiemetic" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should also be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or with which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, deposited or decreases the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin exceeded an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7,9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta had longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">In combination with cisplatin, ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-clonal bronchial carcinoma except for overweight plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with a combination of Lo- cally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approx. 30 minutes after completion of Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">For reduction of incidence and severity of skin reactions, the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after the treatment a corticosteroid will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake should be continued throughout the therapy duration as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each dose, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombolic count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartat-transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking the awareness of the Nadir of the bloodstream or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the pre- hitting treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 which apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleedings.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment must be interrupted by ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that at the age of 65 year- or more in comparison to patients at the age of 65 years an increased side-side risk exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended to all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver dysfunctional restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; to 3.0 times of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) are not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone marrow suppression and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophatic value has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophy, thrombolic number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthatological toxicity like neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to be ordered to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) have to avoid simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylinic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients envisaged for a therapy with Pemetrexed need to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-duration for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, where these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion should be induced in front of the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed consists, men should be advised against the treatment - Ginn to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1,3 g daily) lead to reduced pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advisable when using normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available for the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-value such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with decent antimelites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy, except if strictly required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment, advice regarding the sperm cell viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into mother's milk and unwanted effects in breastfeeding infants cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and Pemetrexed, and 163 patients with mesothelioma, randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antidefolate, which performs its effect by interrupting important and acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies, Pemetrexed acts as anti-folate with several attacking points by blocking the thymidylsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamide ribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folatdependent key enzymes from the de novo Biosynthesis of Thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenteric, randomized, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaided patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-months prolonged survival compared to those patients with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>

<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of taken fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not assessments).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some extent.</seg>

<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects, without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick recovery of the systemic effects that are attributable to the matching properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is carried out in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonds to the active serin-rest of the gastrical and pankatic lipasties.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypocalory, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2542">Waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non metallized orlistat were not measured 8 hours after the oral dosage of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could be found sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, the minimal systemically absorbable dose was administered, two main metabolic metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl leucine group) were identified, representing nearly 42% of the total plasmasis concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapy, the strong cause of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there are not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit for the company of Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy alone due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable in case of a simultaneous dispensing of pallet osetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or if the Qt interval is lengthened or may tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, alopecia must be used for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron was not inhibiting the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazin, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palmetosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with Aloxi related to headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar incidents showed similar incidence of adverse events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effective relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy in an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received medically emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 macplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg of dolasetron (half-value 7,3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without Dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palletietron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including Qtc interval, were comparable to the effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the potential of action.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of the ECG-based Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous application follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-duration of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional throughout the whole dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous dosage of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean average (± SD) increased in 11 testicle-carcinoma patients with 42 ± 34% of the Palonosetron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmakokinetic simulations indicate that once a daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days, total texposition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with that after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the CMAx was higher after the penetration of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated via the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous wound injection in healthy patients, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale Eliminationshalbvereit and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was roughly twice the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and because Aloxi is determined by humans for unique application, the relevance of these results is negligible for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) passed a negative opinion in which the approval for the marketing of the drugs prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicine" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon found data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicine to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was flamed up in more patients than in the reference medicine; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study to examine the question, to what extent the medicine is immune to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lazations, abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven or presumably caused by methicilline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibiting the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indikator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cluttered after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together by skin-dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were detectable or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo were outweighed in the short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and consider an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin ointment, the treatment is aborted, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinopathy is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials involving secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after 2-3 days treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retinopathy and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached by humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptation is not considered necessary when topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the birth and föracial / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / stop or stop the therapy with an altargo should be continued between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most reported side effect of irritation at the date of the appointment that approximately 1% of patients were concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action, Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleiurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of retinapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacteriological ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the PeptidylTransfer Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partially P-Binding Interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance appear to apply the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of retinopathy vis-à-vis S.aureus were found regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-responding to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of man after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 shredded skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinopathy in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with minor involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats microcore test for in-vivo examination chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryonic oxicity study of rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoxicity (decreased body weight of fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccine consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination can be completed from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a tracking dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by helping the immune system (the natural defence of the body)" "" "how it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adults and Twinrix are administered as part of a vaccination of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data used to support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain on the injection point, redness, matureness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission awarded GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the entire company</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primers with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) antibody levels are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis vaccination require a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, the chances of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formal inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccinations may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impairment in the gluteal muscle, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in these cases, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous with thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial, which was carried out with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturism, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in earlier thiomal and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 inoculation doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 up to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy based on a calculation based per vaccination dose, but not based on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects that Ambirix had given had been reported about pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of dexterity was comparable to per proband (i.e. throughout the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects that Ambirix got, compared with 36.2% in subjects that received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced soreness and accuracy was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinine hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme using Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to including 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, a month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for Anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12 - including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunogenicity was valuable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in month 2 and 6 after the 3-dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinine hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-haV- and anti-hBs could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was similar to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formal inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12 - including 15-year-olds it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a blonde face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix does not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before administering both vaccinations (even though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to ambition or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic) in your child / child.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest itself through itching skin rashes, respiration or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled administration of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a form-ininated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective constituents is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination prior to the termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's immune system, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction is on vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2791">It may however be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since issuing the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP represented the view that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has been placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastromstomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach's leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonola could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a headlight medication, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonial can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavor disorders or taste release, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with interferences of the urea cycle effectively prevents ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in the newborn (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifesto form (incomplete enzyme defect manifesting after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use, if a hyperammonary encephalopathy is in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granules form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Daily dose is individually calculated according to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifesto deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthase or orniethinscaris, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with swallowing disorders as there is a risk for the genesis of esophaagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyl rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate is performed over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neural increase was slowed down and a disturbed loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed irritation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anortic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactatacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armordial, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms begin with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for every gram of sodium phenylbutyl rate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylalanine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the incidence of the first symptoms in the newborn was almost always inflicted, and the disease itself resulted in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in post-partum (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first appearance of hyperammonic encephalopathy, survival was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many people with intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late manifesto form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of orniethinscarbamylase deficiency), treated by hyperammonary encephalopathy and treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylphenyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were established.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Following different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) no phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted in 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clastogenic effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken oral (babies and children who can't swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifesto deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthase or orniethinscaris, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contain 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyl rate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyl rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-pipes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before the birth, lesions in the pyramids of the brain cortex came into lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anortic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactatacidosis, severe hypokalemia, armordial, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, the sodium phenylbutyl rate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylalanine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granules form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were established.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot secrete the nitrogen-containing products that accumulate in the body after the intake of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS since the medicine can go to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disappointment of hearing, disoriented disturbance, memory failure and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find any of these symptoms, please contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example in instable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different starch) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomal measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of anoxox was compared with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients with a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin in terms of all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalira, other milins or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Angiox in the entire European Union by The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended Initialdosis of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus addition of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the surgery, an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is supposed to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allergy form of Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolus release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values, the reconditioned and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney dysfunctions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalira udin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second Bolusdose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis check again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal injury, which were included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bivalira-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 days 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous formulation of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous formulation of low-molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Well-known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversibly bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalent is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most of the hemorrhages in arterial puncture points occur in PCI-patients, most bleeding disorders can occur in patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment is in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalent udin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Standardization Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalira again reaches the level existing before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocyte Aggregationshemmer) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalent udin with thrombolic aggregate numbers or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in each case are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are inadequate for the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalira, plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the bivalent group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prevalent than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, as defined in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups of Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture zone, which required a radiological or surgical intervention, reduced hemoglobin levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with known blood point, reoperation due to bleeding, using blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occured at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "misc" positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalira in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI study.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalira group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prevalent than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less in bivalent studies than in the comparative group of Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system organclasses.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with bivalent udin is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalent udin, a direct and specific thromatic inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and the anion region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or tinned.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalira udin to Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the binding of Bivalira udin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalira udin was unable to induce a thrombocyte aggregation reaction in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalent udin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is substantiated by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out below, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg was given Bivalira udin and increases the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the Acuity study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomization) or on the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- alterations or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Primary analysis and results from the Acuity study for the 30 day and the one-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding both in the ACUITY- and Timi-scale up to day 30 for the overall population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol is shown in table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients, Aspirin and Clopidogrel Total population (ITT) according to protocol were given UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + + + GPIIb / IIIa GPIIb / IIIa (N = 2924)% (N = 4604)% (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood point, reoperation due to bleeding, using blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple outcomes of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalent studies were evaluated in patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalira studies as peptide a catabolism in its amino acid levels with subsequent re-utilisation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination takes place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-duration of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10-minutes of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to long-term physiological stress as a response to non-homoeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even at very much higher doses.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose bins made of type 1 glass to 10 ml, sealed with butyl rubber stopper and sealed a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a bottle of angiox and slightly swept until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken out of the piercing bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalira udin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the upper arm, or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter working time than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been used in combination with a long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin cannot be processed effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in the comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lisses.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (regulator), the insulin type (normal, NPH, incandescence, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may make a change of the dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the activity profile of the insulin that is used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that can increase blood glucose activity and increase bias to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopypyramid, fibrate, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterbalance can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympatholysis such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">Insulin is not known whether insulin lulisin enters human breast milk, but insulin is generally not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed according to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable agents known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organcategories and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on availability).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - welness, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual arousal creation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive hun-, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is lined to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person or treated by a doctor with intravenous glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucosur injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin occurs more quickly and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mum, insulin lulisin showed a proportionale glucosine effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportionate increase in the glucosine effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves full glucosity effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postprandial glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin lulisin was harvested 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycemic control is achieved, as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 hours before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisine at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 mins) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malnourished, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
