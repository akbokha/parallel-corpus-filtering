package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some of the features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions set up .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard configuration modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Ab@@ stür@@ ze . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete .
the module View@@ Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ sichts@@ filter@@ . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website . as a pres@@ etting the display begins with the root node of the document , sample : document@@ item , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol / text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graphi@@ cally . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder is the size of a folder as the sum of the number of entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily recognized when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Sitemap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful shade and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View Color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting stit@@ ch or the image of any other file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can determine if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation , or whether the area of secondary h@@ edges should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
in case of algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the case of the Sitemap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always kept . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses due to framework conditions so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive parti@@ tions .
you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry above the menu item View An@@ hold on area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the use of c@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , you will open a dialog with which you can set the look of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a turning field to set the number of thumb@@ nails any line in the gallery .
to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the file names are shown in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery .
in the dialogue folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection , save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ folders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drop @-@ down box allows you to set a slider or a rot@@ ational panel to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld original pictures , you determine if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
using the Comment File , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML code settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins ( Manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ pack ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw file conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ Export and ICC color management - workflow .
improved database with considerably more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all , programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to make the det@@ ector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an item in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also get the digi@@ pack ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ kam ; registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
if you want &amp; digi@@ pack ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ pack ; you will also use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; see each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during the browsing of the folder you will see a progress indicator as shown :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ looks recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this you can add extra @-@ digit &amp; digi@@ kam ; to insert a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change it by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . you will then find more details on the albums section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; digi@@ pack ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My albums and my key@@ word box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you are using the raw @-@ mode of your camera , it may also work with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help resource Assi@@ stance menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
the Photo Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association , also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with Photo@@ 2 . you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ Kam can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ pack is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam will perform itself .
to simpli@@ fy the window , either remove page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in terms of key@@ word , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to lift the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the fil@@ tering on the file name will only work if this ind will display the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ kam will be stored in a single night@@ club . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ bür@@ ste or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Imp@@ orting images . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select Album Import from the screenshot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and select album properties in context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collection : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete albums from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections settings .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date .
the el@@ dest , average , ne@@ sts : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ pack , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu &amp; quot ; As alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau put &amp; quot ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be bl@@ ended .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My keywords left down in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will display the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . which information these are , you can change the digi@@ pack settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the range preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor rest a moment above a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a relief window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... . in the digi@@ pack section , see how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting it from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing through other image editing programs , problems with the met@@ adata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , ap@@ ert@@ ure , etc .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides two options for turning . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ pack ; delete it in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or de@@ f If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way , you can organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , they can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; click &amp; quot ; click on an existing key@@ word and then select a new key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be sub@@ stit@@ uting this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting it . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu that gives you the opportunity to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking the right mouse button and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; Meine Stich@@ wor@@ te@@ quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu as alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use keywords with keywords , first of all , you have to apply your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; Meine Stich@@ wor@@ te@@ quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on thumb@@ nail preview and select keywords from the context menu .
you can assign a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have selected a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can remove a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking the photo &apos;s context menu and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this will display all the related images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all database elements : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits . if you click here , the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if you haven &apos;t found the search , then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can find a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always fil@@ tering what you entered as a search crit@@ erion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be executed . in the view My search list is displayed in the main window . if you want to change your selection again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its contex@@ tual menu .
if you select to edit the search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit an extended search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . for more information , see the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the Search menu .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . all rules are displayed time @-@ wise , separated by operators . one option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can create searching the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CHT@@ DVI .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : hands @-@ free sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ pack ; find the right pictures . also here you can set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can push the mouse wheel in or zoom or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides a light table in a separate window that you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Leucht@@ tisch add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ Main Window , you can open the light table quickly with L Tools .
from the thumb@@ nail you can draw the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you what copy in which window area to see . if you preview thumb@@ nails from the tool@@ bar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then these will also be done with the other picture . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly display from a picture series . if you are using pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas for the same . now , use the left mouse button at any preview image to display it on the left side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course , normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area .
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom kno@@ b among the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers that come &amp; digi@@ pack ; we will review downloading , ren@@ aming , editing , group@@ ing , backup , backup , backup , backup , backup , maintain , and export image files .

met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is used in accordance with your definition data , the information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to take longer a certain photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you engage in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive some@@ time .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in the same place in one year . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files match together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to be stored in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently store the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do that , &amp; digi@@ kam will provide a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign each photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work .
let &apos;s now use keywords , keywords as you often refer to other programs or continue to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically mount the tree for you or insert images to the right place . converting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging one sub@@ tree to another . the changed key@@ word will be taken by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks down the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is inter@@ cep@@ ted . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are the properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your met@@ adata .
you just want to let anybody know your photos , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance you can &apos;t even see a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can store any amount of text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time for the publication .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation drives now with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already unbe@@ atable and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can re@@ export your travels virtually using images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export the photos at the recording location . you can also export the images by Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc ; with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information should be stored in the set @-@ up page of &amp; digi@@ pack ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , for example , to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author Title : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be filled too .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete them , in the image embedded met@@ adata , delete or modify . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ pack ; will provide such a module for stac@@ king processing in the near future .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , current trends , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , p@@ aving prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we &apos;re not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , problems with the so @-@ called New Media are concerned .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs these must be handled and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , and dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to mistakes , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard disks , fl@@ ash@@ cards , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ex@@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot .
Disk@@ manufacturers retain your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk fail@@ ures
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest when you operate at a temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature levels , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART may not detect this error . some of SM@@ ART detected errors termin@@ ate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these may cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember that not each connector also includes over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it offers protection against lightning impact and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage sha@@ vers , which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply .
besides protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power out@@ age occurs . some models have the possibility to store your data and shut down the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular choice with which you can store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are cleaned up automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it contains a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one says you have occurred in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . it is quite disturb@@ ing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate interactions within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of errors per year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk fail@@ ures on low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a G@@ PL compliant license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the share of the theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time , no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less pr@@ one to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 lens settings from fundamental physical limitations . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise character@@ is@@ ations for all types of light sensors are far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras come in the direction of the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of disks .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ plane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster@@ ism always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last difference in the system .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system , with the exception that it only stops and is not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to recover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file , retain IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memories , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predict@@ able due to your nature , you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available to everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ db ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 , and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary format that is slowly dis@@ appearing from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can but much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage is that there is relative abundance of administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow communication .
TIFF can be stored in an un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
the digital Neg@@ ative file format is a free and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use met@@ adata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is already available to DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can use it at some point .
this is probably one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ml@@ gt ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers put it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , archive . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems with the link between the met@@ adata file and the image file , and as stated above , the raw format will be old . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible Online met@@ adata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered process . if you edit the images once again , you should add the met@@ adata again , which may be cut off by the other programs .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , en@@ code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print and etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a ready @-@ to @-@ use indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings will be displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata tab displays the internal met@@ adata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these met@@ adata is not available on some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ pack ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired language selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then select S@@ elected . the button selected is checked until you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . in this case the new images have been marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download all the buttons or download the selected images , a dialog will display where you can select the target album in which the photos are disc@@ ar@@ ded . the list of existing albums is displayed , as usual folder sorted , displayed . details of the folder sorting can be found in the My albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by selecting the Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you have to select it first and use er@@ ased deleted ones .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be carefully checked if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera screen , you should do this over the camera above , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually util@@ ised again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames when you upload photos of different recording myst@@ eries to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for fil@@ ming and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be automatically created per day .
the options Wh@@ ile the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . for more custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you can change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ pack ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic turn during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic turn is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , leave &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ pack ; use this to automatically load sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ ben option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the Download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ pack ; you where the images should be up@@ loaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users want to send the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to take the position data of a photo .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that extra iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic allocation ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to store these data in the g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ characters sti@@ ff coordinates , which are created for example by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control about his work processes as possible . there are many settings that have the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you have to choose from the menu settings , set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing will be set . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and ur@@ gency data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author Title is a syn@@ onym for fas@@ cia : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be names such as photograph@@ ed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the field , it must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this results in the fact that the met@@ adata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these met@@ adata are also available in other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. they can be imported without lost .
save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . this allows your labelling to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ pack ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the actu@@ alization button to the right of each category .
the settings of the light@@ box from &amp; digi@@ pack ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the light table , these settings will be switched on . however , some images have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colours are specified here . in the image processing , this view@@ finder can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ous density than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
with the pn@@ g compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF @-@ files you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works without loss .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast evolving into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . if you use this option , you solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight on a white card .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the sh@@ ot@@ ters , so the parts of your images are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the sh@@ ot@@ ters as a continuous white . use the setting @-@ through white in the settings . the setting colors will generate some unusual results , as it displays the top lights in various rose tones . last@@ ly , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible since blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how many color or white you want .
if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; editing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ geneous gen@@ eity direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , as you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions on how to return it again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a colour space to translate into the others so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folders Find here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ pack ; then examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images do not manage the entire screen .
the profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which does not contain any color mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma cor@@ re@@ cts not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to do the mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is for them . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize style for the destination : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; frame review and image editing . by picking up this interface can &amp; digi@@ pack ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded from &amp; digi@@ pack . these modules appear as new entries in the main window and in addition , you will also find some examples in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes turn off the met@@ adata which is displayed at the bottom of the pictures while displaying .
the camera properties show a list of all cameras supported at the left . on the right there is a button automatic detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and supported in the picture mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
try the camera automatically . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving images into the du@@ st@@ bin you can display the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly handled by &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any call@@ backs . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also indicate the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; at startup , this acceler@@ ates the start process from &amp; digi@@ pack ; .
setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ pack ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under settings design . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting the entry Display / Edit page .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ pack ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you may also custom@@ ize a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button The button Rest@@ ore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time .
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or re@@ produced . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Back or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the cat@@ walk and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also rever@@ ted or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in the photo and zoom in by using C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select the magni@@ fication factor
View full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come into the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not wish to do so , you can change this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can see this in the Settings dialog . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image print in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . all image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ ter Druck@@ assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the edge .
the description below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compliant , meaning that all special characters are allowed . the descriptions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
once you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . you can also read other met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is ur@@ gency written in the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used beforehand .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered key@@ word . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords on a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter .
the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ word , and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a cal@@ ender tag . the key@@ word filter refers to no key@@ word , which reduces the amount to three images , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
if you have created and created a rule and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s more specific implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ controlled workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come a predict@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ controlled workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web that match your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color administration means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with a lot of background information about color administration .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , since s@@ RGB works in cal@@ li@@ bration . if you work as a colour space of s@@ RGB , then you have to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB @-@ standard cal@@ li@@ bration , use a fitting monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic offset and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try to make the most of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the volume levels over the entire image , allowing the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
compens@@ ating : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ escence factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . it sometimes achiev@@ es very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light bor@@ es and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible in images washed and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ ym . they start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click the sub@@ window .
thumb@@ nail preview features a red marker . the pixel &apos;s lumin@@ ance under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or di@@ mming the sh@@ ading details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors , if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later .
the pres@@ et button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also produce another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
here you can adjust the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high quality images . this coding also needs more disk space , time time and is only available for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles enables you to consult chapter color management .
another important tool is to find sound correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to use your settings for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Color Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the tool colour effects , tool colour effects , provides you with four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure put out a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the picture . this was the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . just try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ s ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to see the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all the changes you perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is a tool for improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of slider for the application purpose .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or range . under the graph three slide into the inside are cli@@ cked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and make sure the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , refres@@ hed . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to adjust the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three paint p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators which can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output parameters can be used e.g. to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and then loaded again . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , medium and sunny shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image preview to set the hist@@ ograms of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this sel@@ ector allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that were recorded with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most sensu@@ al . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide bar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a kur@@ ve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dar@@ ker Aus@@ gab@@ et@@ ö@@ nen and that the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
to preview the original photos is a red marking . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shade and sunny shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the digi@@ pack ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ ers of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel mix@@ ers then DAS tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour@@ ing . color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that don &apos;t appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first reduce the color space .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic asc@@ ension effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light scenes at the time of the day . thus similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , irrespective of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged items or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu item Image texture modi@@ fying the image processing can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . permanently the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce ran@@ det it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple format@@ ted text into a picture at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be .
each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool template can be applied to lay a template over an image .
the Image menu template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over an image .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template from the template , simply send an email in English to the digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ liste digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to put your sten@@ cil @-@ folder with the root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil board . selecting a folder will update the templates automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b reduces the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digit@@ alization process colors with minimal differences to a col@@ oring point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little bit bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more after@@ ward shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already using a shar@@ pen@@ er while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate sharp@@ ness .
you should be careful with this however , as the results do not work very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most usable technique to shar@@ pen an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus on the menu item Kor@@ rig@@ ieren . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much simpler than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten it with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft drawing and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help you edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will create near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a can@@ te are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore images should be best shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image to be added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . thus , a minimum difference is defined thereby for an edge of the filter applied . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore fl@@ aws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it remo@@ ves the focus . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus mostly reaches better results than bl@@ ur@@ red .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß . the g@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ els that are far from original source pixel . the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß foot is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very sharp , but then pay attention to holy vou@@ chers .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise Fil@@ ters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor . a good value is 0.0@@ 3 . a high value will still further pol@@ lu@@ te the image .
g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should allow this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of matri@@ ces size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate . note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , non @-@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practical , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
this picture has been made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b regul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of the range that was dark@@ ened to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the CI@@ mg project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings to fine adjust the rider smoothing and advanced settings .
detail ret@@ aining p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smooth and smooth . a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gra@@ ined or CCD Rau@@ schen , a high value generates wav@@ ed pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ th@@ ness factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create an &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ p effect it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . usually , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ gauge as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is cho@@ osen , it should be cho@@ osen as well . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more in quality you get by choosing this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the running time . we recommend it to om@@ it it out .
the buttons Save as and loading make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be adjusted to a text file and then loaded again .
correct image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the drop @-@ down button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using Small Art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is an intr@@ insi@@ cally black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by poor fil@@ ing during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce the noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward in order to see light changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ation occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . put it on a value close to the max@@ im if you want to remove a weak smoke or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ act without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ ma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more rough@@ ened , but also the shadow areas .
atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the phase jet . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at edges . it can remove diamond tips and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is lab@@ eled with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to shar@@ pen the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ness and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sches Rau@@ schen , Film@@ kör@@ ung , Kr@@ atz@@ er , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ sp@@ ectively digi@@ ti@@ zed images . the smoothing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . texture replacement is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the CI@@ mg project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some comp@@ res@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo restor@@ ing can be saved in a text file and then loaded again .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera added to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old photo photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanning and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel from photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ quality photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark bild sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button Dunkel@@ bild . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all thumb@@ nails .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
duration : an average of the neigh@@ bor &apos;s pixels is measured . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic finish ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , are often unable to illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 while the ap@@ ert@@ ure filter increases , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an ap@@ ert@@ ure of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise trigger effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gray stage of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,0 , resulting in an optical filter with ap@@ ert@@ ure setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the kno@@ bs only provide positive values as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation . image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second count handles the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth degree cor@@ re@@ cts the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion second degree . with negative values can be corrected t@@ onn@@ en@@ shaped distor@@ tions and positive values of cushion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distor@@ tion fourth density . this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; corners &quot; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value calcul@@ ates the image size and thus creates a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustr@@ ates the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all first . if you are cutting a new image and then perform a t@@ onn@@ en@@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ e- / kis@@ sing distor@@ tion using the lines .
if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing or over the zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs like shots from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared movie by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add Film gran@@ ulator option if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of the film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mix@@ es colour channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color formations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared cinem@@ at@@ ography applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Filter Film@@ grains is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one in the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the regul@@ ator can cali@@ br@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an age @-@ protected protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for larger images . fl@@ atten the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edit is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel larger image is 1 and smoo@@ thed 17 .
the ink pattern uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon cap . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dient change are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur defines your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the engraving is a quick tool to re@@ produce your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tion @-@ effects . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ el@@ es 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wav@@ ef@@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n using copy@@ righ@@ ted material .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : wi@@ pes the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in athle@@ tic photography .
radi@@ al un@@ har@@ ness : dist@@ ort the image by turning the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ red of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement un@@ har@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ har@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur the image soft@@ ly into the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
sho@@ oter sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image through random displac@@ ement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pe it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops to your image . this makes it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ pack ; editing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ coding mirrors .
photo super@@ ases is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the CI@@ mg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to im@@ pe@@ de the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the CI@@ mg project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create an &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ p effect it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and loading are used exactly . each image size can be enlarged as text file and then loaded again .
photo super@@ ases is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
you can see an example for photo bl@@ oss@@ oms below , by enlar@@ ging a small photo on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication compared .
editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ gone surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . editing the image allows you to create a photo with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut away . this gives you a good overview how your photo would look like after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The Cut button of the image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview range , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or landscape format . in the high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned to the width .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the inter@@ connection help allow you to blend in so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bow , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are an opportunity to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf@@ lets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used in ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition condu@@ cts the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this kind .
one more rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the gold tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral they discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that unlike harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic .
use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to do transformation Free rotation and adjust the angle .
rot@@ ate your image with the slider angle . the settings on this slider are specified in degrees . with the pres@@ ets button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown at the top right .
for your help , the Free Rot@@ ation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture you will find unwanted trig@@ onal holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ieren cro@@ pping from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the rotation . but keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spek@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get un@@ pleas@@ urable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transform@@ ations cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ former sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line will be displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture gets a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shifts bear double the amount of bias and therefore you should avoid this .
after shaving , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this happens on the file extension and compare it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will display &amp; digi@@ pack ; see the file extension list . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes to digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced so as to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the configuration section you will find more information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ pack ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ates that come from &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use the &amp; k@@ de settings to start playing the program for playback .

if you s@@ wap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting with the White balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ pack ; include your description here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft sign , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , sharp m@@ ask@@ eting , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture modi@@ fies ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left panel displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview range .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photo . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can push the mouse wheel in or zoom or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit colour pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allet or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the p@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed @-@ left mouse button .
if the An@@ m cur@@ sor is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either , or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected , you can set this mode by selecting the tick field under Com@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created in such a way as in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Insert .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end sign if another color follows . if three numbers are in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program that includes &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ calcul@@ ates the graph@@ s and in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; opening or opening the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; in one &amp; more ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required are :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list includes opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item settings k@@ olo@@ graph ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; instance or display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the start of the program you can re@@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided onto several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .

the Rest@@ t store page gives the possibility to specify behavior if a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or ask the program any time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z and layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ y model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ cker@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm calcul@@ ates the verti@@ ces circular in accordance with the description of Six and tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ene file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or change the graph@@ ene with a filter before it is drawn .

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images of a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item to scan , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source you want to fetch the image here . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values of your own , in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview and custom@@ ize the area to your needs before using the button scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ - &gt; screen shot ... a window will appear in which you can set the different screen shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete desktop reading , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screenshot is made , the dialog options of the target image appears with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit in the met@@ adata of an image . ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS tracking as an XML file in the g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above dialog appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data which were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic cor@@ relation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation indicates an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below will be merged , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2,000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for pictures , you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and Differ@@ ence options in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates . if you know that in reality , a location is located in a major time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box shows the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to facilitate the best internation@@ alization .
the player selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will show the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab displays the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture create a page creates a gallery in which each image will get an own page . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , it also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press ab@@ ort to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . therefore , you can read the error messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .

after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ l.@@ Attention : the participants of this list speak English .

with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied by clicking the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please see ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slideshow .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tool and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the m@@ peg slide show . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow .
the images you selected are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio , where you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all your settings , you can start generating the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tool and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the Settings button at the bottom .
the print assist@@ ent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print using the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original itat is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the preview preview , you can see the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG version can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the exec@@ utable button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it to cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent . further images can be drawn to the list of pictures to be sent and place there .
after you have launched the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you selected . add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected picture , you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it in order to add you to the list of pictures to be sent .
the images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject .
most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , add the comments to the images in a text file and add the mail .
the PNG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the image to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the closing button you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions about how to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions by using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card since otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner while presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an end loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random sel@@ ects a different effect between the images at each passing between the images .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
at the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub @-@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through this , see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails .
if you click on the entry with the mouse , the browser view changes . see the picture .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images beside the names , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the image asset @-@ window ( described in more detail ) and select the entry Categories list in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after images , on which Jesus , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ enshots and the introdu@@ ctory videos .
start &amp; co@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , start the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or start the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview screen .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will be shown in thumb@@ nail only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ectives . in the following , every area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is shown on the overview page . see more about the export files in .
last@@ ly , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from specific viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear why this is not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this will allow those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more download images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub @-@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , properly functioning , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described are all of them related to root folders or UR@@ Ls . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the picture information , persons on the pictures , place of recording , etc . , then you have to do this work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and this file can be shared as independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for exp@@ orting images , which you can access through the File Ex@@ ports File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the option Manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy the Automati@@ cally to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can specify the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... choose , you will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you will person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named by your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked to import the categories of the file to be imported and what categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it has to be easy to browse photos and see : if you see pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Fix@@ ing the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , it is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use it in future starting again . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album ; you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings box photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained .
on the left you see six different symbols with which you can view settings options and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
you can choose different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords for each picture . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in the Dialog options you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member , as explained in the dialog .
in the left side of the selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ Kam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . please refer to the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the module modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the modules .
because the modules are used by several applications together , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested only very little . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures . Demo @-@ Database can either be called using the command line using the command &gt; photo@@ album Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules with a photo@@ album ; not working . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that K@@ IP@@ I also use is that other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
here you can simul@@ ate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that &apos;s just the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected persons and the module will pass it on .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the modules you want to load .
in the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo@@ album ; start with your own images .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , see the top menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar , you see the window that you have entered into your image database . currently , you will not find a lot of information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been taken . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures of Jesus is pic@@ tured and all images were recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , so that the names used are moved up , the persons can find and assign more quickly .
if you prefer to display an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a sub @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ otation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can easily draw an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ otation dialog by clicking on the lad@@ der , which form the top edges of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window pane .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to display this window again later , use the button Options ... and here window opens / f@@ ade . this can be seen in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images if you have not set a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button down . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use images anywhere without saving you on your hard disk . of course you have to store the images somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that the preview of these images can be displayed . you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ ying how to avoid the m@@ ess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those are left , which you may want to make for others in@@ accessible and click here to lock all the images that your little sister may see , cont@@ emplate and lock the menu item All out of current view .
this allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your little sister to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so that all pictures you have blocked can be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy Menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all pictures on the hard disk and secondly anyone who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to for@@ bid those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to for@@ bid the view on private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , you have a photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from pre@@ viewing as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it displays the image , but additional all information you have to enter through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see the appropriate entries for this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the images high and above . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . and photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image by pressing C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or Min@@ us . start and stop the slide show through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful viewer &apos;s ability to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image in the image and zoom out . to the zo@@ oming zoom , you can simply draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom into the center of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image does not show zo@@ omed . the zo@@ oms set the zo@@ oms so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
keep in mind that the only zo@@ om@@ operations work in videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ key .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to draw images with features while you see them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by putting the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , they are available in the browser . so if you have all the images that you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all of them at once with notes . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you display categories in the preview screen , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way , you can undo your painted later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to switch to the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture , select from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object since all objects are already selected by the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu .
if there are more possible positions , the following pop @-@ up menu will be displayed so that you can select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on users again or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the Pov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with help .
you need the Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL User documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the property view .
click on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross local .
the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a visual level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need a different layout , you can set it as you like . you can also store several window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of the view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to assign multiple views to one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the card cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to trigger a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left to the left .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the thumb@@ nail . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with View Window ordering ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be correctly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the rendering icon Ren@@ dering the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene render scene rendering .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon of the render settings in the tool@@ bar or choose R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but makes sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode .
in the card card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the cross section sub@@ section and enter the image section to rendering into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , several errors may arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as default is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling covers the neighboring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel depends again and again , because the rec@@ ur depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a gr@@ ating of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and will be checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is that generating noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel then becomes transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ wiz@@ ard ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor in order to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter information ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
you can set the object of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick the High level of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick check@@ ups , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . you will find more precise information about the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window regulations or create new window assign@@ ments . in the window layout section explains how to create and store window orders .
the standard window layout box : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; uses the chosen win@@ dow@@ pane to start the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Clear .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window list . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with card card , you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have Pov@@ ray and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow every step in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should note the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed all error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view property properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s destination . simply click on a check@@ point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the App@@ ly button or the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a fa@@ der ( Insert finished body squ@@ ad ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a troubles@@ ome method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the application button or the input key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select First Sign . the pig@@ ment will then change in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , by clicking on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the Pig@@ ment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then preview the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the Object Tree , select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to perform this step as you have already understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input key or button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has moved over the floor , since you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now a strange result : as already previously seen , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as a color :
select First Properties and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment tab , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties :
then change the values as shown in the following scre@@ enshots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and refle@@ ctance already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it offers . hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tracing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ps a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog influence .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing .
save the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change or add new short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can use this option to add and remove machine symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; there are five fl@@ ash@@ cards . in three of them , general and edit and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option save &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; while moving the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can also set up a few of the file types that the program can display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
click here to change the key@@ word for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; in the fl@@ ash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ STAR@@ show ; will also be closed if there is no longer open browser window .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to it , at least problems and possible improvements .
the menu provides an entry with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all information needed is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list by &amp; show@@ photograph ; in this mailing list English is spoken , so you should be able to speak English .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to join the developer mailing list is to join the developer mailing list .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control about his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up a show@@ shot . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators you can select the color which is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display , contrast . exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer can scan and store images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer visu@@ alize and store images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save images or store the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard sc@@ anners can be placed on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel it &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly treated .
to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ shot scan and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read using the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and par@@ sed ? en leads to a break and you get back into the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving will have to display a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , which is to automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix that is recorded each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the kno@@ b over starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below is a list of these ab@@ brevi@@ ations and their function . the global key zel can set up you by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up glob@@ als . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok , by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and specify short commands ... .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use a dialogue so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can replace your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Switch the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is collected . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example met@@ adata or piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . in order to add a separate entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script management can also install script pack@@ ets that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.g. scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension of amar@@ k@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the main script needs to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is done , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wiki Scrip@@ ts Page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Scrip@@ ts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to go through endless menus . you may just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collector &apos;s Browser and Quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can activate or disable for comp@@ iling when using the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options certain dependen@@ cies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort about the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window in addition to the play@@ list ( or . if the option is disabled , only the play@@ list window will be displayed ) .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
make it more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed .
set mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current play@@ list automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files based on the play@@ list &apos;s location , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece of play , that the play@@ list window opens / rolls to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context @-@ browser , automatically switch the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can custom@@ ize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s look . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting separate fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray presented section will be activated . you can select writings for the following area : play@@ list window , player window and context @-@ browser . press to select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
by choosing user defined color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ections enabled below for foreg@@ round and background color .
continue playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display sub@@ window allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colours are used .
the Display text input field introduces the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear to be the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the sel@@ ector box . some drivers activate additional adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which is &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the play@@ lists added automatically will then appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the component collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , further installation is required in the My@@ S@@ ql facility .
the My@@ S@@ ql setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using the calcul@@ ator : will type the host on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ fm does the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website .
send down pieces and thus refres@@ h the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm @-@ profile .
calls for similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar performers will be retri@@ eved . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the file be created again .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib is short@@ ened when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then des@@ elect it . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the email will automatically open during a crash ) . if this is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in status bar ( random mode / re@@ play / dynamic play@@ list ) always appear in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ k@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ k@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ k@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are solved most easily by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if something is wrong with the fixing of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list will appear .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub @-@ window was converted to the statistic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the score by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column displayed . click anywhere in the new App@@ ly column to specify the review for one piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From play@@ list from the drop down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let it fall there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the Add button , you can save the play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be supported by Which media types supports G@@ Stream@@ er / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost any concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include any MP3 decoder in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ wise reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 ke , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device needs to deplo@@ y a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously distribute audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. sb@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. a sink ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media needs to be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er Drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . ensure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . the aug@@ mented sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you must register all the components . follow the g@@ st register to register all of the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stream@@ er .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ config ) and run g@@ st @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . make an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music that you stopped before bed@@ time .
how do you know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; what are the current titles when you are on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the current play : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right Mouse buttons puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . pressing the input key after a search in the play@@ list will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the Control Panel &apos;s section ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HOME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ ok &apos;s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the menu to play audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ centage FROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result .
you can apply the valuation for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the play@@ list window . then you can change the valuation of a piece exactly as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select app@@ rais@@ als or edit F2 . you can also edit the review in the met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term set of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ating in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar setup ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it then under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid any difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor &amp; control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click the Settings button and select Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of bug reports are caused .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stream@@ er , so the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
pres@@ um@@ ably , use a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , you need to install the G@@ Stream@@ er de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok again .
I get the fault G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stream@@ er , the G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stream@@ er fa@@ ad .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator g@@ st register . then you rest@@ art Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up in Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not going to be looked after . of course , you are not allowed to take this issue yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed maint@@ ainer for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the wiz@@ ard simply don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the play@@ list . the small text field to filter the collection makes you search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can save it by using the play@@ list button . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ list browser . if the play@@ list is included in the folders of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a play@@ list , you will find various ways to load the play@@ list .
to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the play@@ list and press the Play button .
the audio CD @-@ function uses the audio @-@ audio protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Burn function is also available in the play@@ list . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu . here you have different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a play@@ list that is superior to all others . the play@@ list window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and play@@ list .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play time , bit rate and sampling rate of the current play . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time for remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch to the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the running text display also contains the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set e@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Klassik to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the e@@ quali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the tick field e@@ quali@@ zer , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed play@@ list of all multimedia players available . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent play@@ list features , such as the context browser . the play@@ list itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current play . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser @-@ design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub @-@ windows are later used in detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information can be collected in the statistic window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub @-@ window shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to im@@ itate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current play . you see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recomm@@ ended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the pop @-@ up menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you see the content of the album .
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the play@@ list from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub @-@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is needed .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are om@@ itted .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ ter , and below it will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ tiert after Interpre@@ t und dann nach dem Jahr des Albums in desc@@ ending order ( latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter - their pieces are shown first by genre and among them sorted by interpre@@ ter .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above but additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you have any changes to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section to the play@@ list in this manual .
the search filter is a selection box where you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This le@@ ases the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you are asked for a name where the list is to be stored .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces to the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpre@@ ter burn / burn on CD - Dad@@ ong the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n items ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialogue for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files to the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
highlight Collection Mark@@ up - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards the album is no longer listed under Differ@@ ent artists but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ list browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these are using &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ Window Media Player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok is started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after performer sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required titles from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list . if you are done , click App@@ ly . as a result , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . if the transmission is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a set URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input key , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : in this case dropped files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all the pieces attached to you for playing . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter the letter , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the back button so long until the text field is empty again .
when you enter separate words separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries , include whit@@ esp@@ ace , then complete the key@@ word with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the commentary bad .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned .
the play@@ list tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the play@@ list . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add play@@ list to the play@@ list . to the right , you can save play@@ list , empty play@@ list and bl@@ iss .
next , the buttons will follow the way back and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the center of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window using the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example play@@ lists and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... choose .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the play@@ list . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed simply by clicking twice in the relevant display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . in addition , disable the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list in the menu . you can access the Settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting promotions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can select what should be shown in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your big default in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece in the queu@@ e , the play@@ list will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the play in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the play@@ list . you can then change the order of the pieces in queu@@ e management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details for setting up these follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm -@@ Recomm@@ end@@ ations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ fm profile for this dynamic play@@ list .
double click on the play@@ list you want to play , drag them to the play@@ list window or right @-@ click on you and then select Load . thus , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list . you should save the old play@@ list under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ umed mode mix and play@@ list mix instantly popul@@ ate your play@@ list and you can start playing right away . the play@@ list Recomm@@ ended pieces begin with an empty play@@ list and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , activate the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing play@@ list as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New Players button fills the current play@@ list and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the ability to click Edit . then the dialog to edit the play@@ list settings opens .
enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not listen double in this play@@ list . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed while the setting is played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the play@@ list . this allows you to easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the play@@ list after each played . if you are setting more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the Settings on the right side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you tick .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by starting the script and then click on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts where you can install a script package . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . then select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information for writing your own scripts , please refer to the section W@@ rite scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , just activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in 4 steps you will need to create an audio CD . to track the steps , you have to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy @-@ pr@@ un@@ ed formats , remember that when you re @-@ en@@ code MP3 a bad quality will be obtained , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you have to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program runs audio or data CD &apos;s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burning all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; and extends these functions even . hence , sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc digital audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio enco@@ ding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary tool that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a full @-@ featured author &apos;s system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . it can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and hasn &apos;t been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for every un@@ stored project what to do with it , just as if you called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not stored there will be ques@@ tioned what will happen to you as if you had called file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are drag@@ ging the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you do not use files for multiple sessions . it is intended for you rather than help for you to view the files and folders already available on the media .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you would like to burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning , if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . it also allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which will then eventually burn later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all@@ ein@@ clu@@ ding . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities to change size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view turns out or off . the folder view displays an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the table of contents enables selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the mapping settings below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the right per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the Settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task will be crucial to which the accompanying programs will give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line utility . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternati@@ vely you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then receive a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void get@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( cur@@ l ur@@ l , Q@@ String span ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String span ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface Cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Base ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the UI of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( comp@@ ress ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter which is Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; otherwise it is not possible to cover any copy protection . in any case it may not be a protected audio CD ; even avoid the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting the setup only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained later on . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
the CD@@ DB request of CD data is started according to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the code settings tab in the Setup dialog - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the Main Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder , to set up the En@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the correct enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &quot; sh@@ orts &quot; or &quot; monkey &quot; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can re@@ produce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders create very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality in lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car hi @-@ fi systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that manually entered or automatically fet@@ ched through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the enco@@ der program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there are often a combination of code settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; cd title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of yourself into the calcul@@ ator . it is worth not@@ ing that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note : this is meant by the author ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . all information can be received anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending one address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when calling the data from the server ( but this may only know the progra@@ mmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirr@@ oring servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; cd ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet .
to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders can be found in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and read@@ ings and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered non @-@ free software . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to copy it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each exhibit@@ ing &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it with every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the read@@ out program to allow it to read the &amp; CD data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be so f@@ aded / entered as shown in the screenshot .
just select in case of incomplete information so that you will be informed if information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD collect data automatically via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet during reading the &amp; cd , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; tag and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , then de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 620 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls can block the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : ap@@ ology , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom Fol@@ der for Temp@@ orary Files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be le@@ av@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wise , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each exhibit@@ ing &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ enshots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than pick it out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in section Ques@@ tions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; cd ; gives , a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not select the check@@ box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screenshot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Title &apos; field , unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful recall of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any und@@ esi@@ rable statements .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the Settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the enco@@ der &apos;s help to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the release CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each row of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
click on the tab assign@@ ments to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully codi@@ fied are marked with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem for simultaneous reading and coding ( of however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS is a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with C@@ VS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is addressed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays scre@@ enshots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still read it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eable with this suggestion .
strange when you succeeded to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; next to others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time recording of text also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ mi@@ di players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asound image driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen using changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ essions or tex@@ tures ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
if you are &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the l@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window into the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the item to play from the menu or press the bar button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid window . ( for multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed of playback . to get back the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space key acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use song exter@@ mination and another both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can define which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event type , select the entries of the properties or the property rights from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you can summar@@ ize . these will be played by the series . in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the Collection chapter below the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . in the beginning this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the wished in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . consider that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to add a song to the button . it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally adding to the collection , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . then this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be set new .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to ski@@ p a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pres@@ ent piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow key left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map contains general MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sounds a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM instruments and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except for the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define key@@ map &quot; name of key@@ map ... &quot; END define key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; END definition CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument requires to tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun @-@ shot . to do this , add the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun @-@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which audio is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch the patch , where each sound represents a different perc@@ ussi@@ onist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify notes on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel . see for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to another . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply take it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ ce@@ Patch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value for pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds up to one oct@@ ave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played tones . in the Settings menu , select Settings below the point channel view : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices with very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , that &apos;s why it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , activate automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I open a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or go ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) . in this way I have to change when the collection is finished or I want to play a file , just move into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , turn Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening of files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set up automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ MI@@ D and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to move on to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for me . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , send me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and won &apos;t get money from anybody . I would like to stress that I only get more progra@@ mmer because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - corrected the defect that the pitch at A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also goes Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing of A@@ WE support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ eker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mag@@ nus Pfeffer , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even only a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid may also be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at images . you will also find links to pages with additional kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card unless you can of course hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as playback DVD s , VCD s , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a window with the play@@ list .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries played after each other , you should use the section Perman@@ ent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you click on an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the indicated entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to choose the play@@ list from the menu and select either the edit mode or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the same play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can be switched on only by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files ..
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 top option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturb@@ ing during the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be showing a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; In@@ digo &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here the output of m@@ player is visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; all has to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be used to paste the special em@@ bed field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the Con@@ figuration dialog file must be specified by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is in a con@@ soles application to start and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a pre @-@ set back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on will play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device and TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to be used must be figured out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ linux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
it uses dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ m@@ source .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after the device is binding . it is imper@@ ative to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why do I need to check my CPU each time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; K@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably is used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the tile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact will be made via the tile ; website .
if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed on the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex , and the powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; works ; and to experience its possibilities , the book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can work directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unci@@ ation : lay @-@ TECH . use the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( top lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
while here is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to be able to master ; good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other drawing languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the most general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text @-@ set are specified , as well as an KÃ ¶ r@@ per with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Assistant from &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document .
document classes : this is used to select the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; text &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ ty@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as default . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when writing German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides - as well as other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; K@@ ile , it is most likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is likely to be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and excitement .
when typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the add @-@ on line to send the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the settings K@@ ile ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files the return search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; zip @-@ dependent file ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; tile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; Viewer for the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI , file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output at &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the return search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are associated with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been cli@@ cked . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place will be j@@ umped in the DVI ; viewer .
master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set over project project settings .
quick build : the source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI , file is based on Ã@@ µ@@ n@@ der@@ s.@@ â ¢ } and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast @-@ build process .
when viewing the processing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick installation of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for fast incorpor@@ ation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ fÃ ¼ g@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Fur@@ ther is for items such as keywords , fu@@ zz marks or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , a picture or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( choice for a selection field ) .
using quote will display a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is required to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop down box named Count@@ ess e is used for setting up the font size e . there can be specified the font sizes for the main text , the R &amp; D notes , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two options are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting document type and stac@@ king the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the cl@@ asp according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font set . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu or the Kn@@ op@@ f quick build .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; allows storing automatically .
if the document comp@@ lies , it should be searched for errors . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font raised e 12 is created and only a few countries should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ huge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the establishment of the font green within the environment .
the changes are only super@@ vised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile is now followed .
once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be carried out . to do this , there should be a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem to apply to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI , file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and split it .
DVI , is a very dependent file format ( E e V ice I n@@ ologies ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DVI , file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using a file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI , file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into known other formats can begin by means of the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar .
the default search opens the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all and lat@@ ex binary files . to do this , only Modern under settings must be set up ... Tools are selected .
the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source code , and then cli@@ cked to default search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer then takes place then .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as a text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should an error occur when using the Quick Building of the &amp; DVI , the error may occur . if an error occurs , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the source code sni@@ pp@@ ets the source code in the source code . in the editor you can use the header &apos;s La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ge between errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the faul@@ ty line .
when cli@@ cked on the relevant button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . pre @-@ set options are :
if you select a blank document , a document can be re@@ written from scratch , or the wiz@@ ard can be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , please refer to the section below .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file Template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings General are set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and thus verb@@ ose the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , the template can then be selected instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . a simple way to create a template should be searched by one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; K@@ ile ; uses &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; works ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and creating from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be made directly from &amp; K@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn about his possibilities , the book should be drawn up to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can work directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X Reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par will be selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , portions of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source tex@@ tes and emphasize these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants can include additional br@@ anding marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items are br@@ anded or the corresponding keys make the jump to the next or last jump .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; kate , has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions are added for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for selecting a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection .
paragra@@ phs a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with valid lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning will include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; statements and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for cl@@ apping a part of the document nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ lich will be selected first and removed by pressing the key Del ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands are included in the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit selection paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; K@@ ile ; for additional commands under adap@@ ting environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to host the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , the super@@ ficial view can quickly be lost . this command bu@@ ys the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not destroyed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from working environments .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing cl@@ asp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the soft stap@@ le of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly get lost . this command bu@@ ys the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two easy reference marks are used as a valid se@@ aler . for the purpose @-@ bearing implementation , the character is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign is used for two easy reference marks .
this automatic mount of double address signs can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used to use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French license plates . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the command \ \ item is not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
the current line with \ \ \ \ termin@@ ates the current line with \ \ \ \ .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to assign the columns in tables environments , and thereby all@@ ude all Et @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; try to achieve this . when pushing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; K@@ ile ; after the current tab is not the same , add &amp; K@@ ile ; some spac@@ er for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under settings K@@ ile ... fully custom@@ is@@ able .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of input is removed and the default list is sub@@ stituted . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are natural when selecting a command . alternatively , it can be set by &amp; K@@ ile , so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible by editing br@@ anding marks and the desired parameters can then be set .
under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected various types lists for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher des Allgemeine Langu@@ ages .
command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters entered with \ \ begin and the call of default mode will have a large list of ambient comm@@ its . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for the execution of environments is provided .
when calling the fully supported environment or the key Alt + Shift key Space key , the command to open the environment is automatically set and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient execution can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key will be termin@@ ated .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile , recogni@@ zes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be set .
under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste des ver@@ voll@@ stÃ ¤ n@@ digt mode fÃ ¼ r &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; K@@ ile ; supported custom lists of he@@ aders , which are immediately replaced by more len@@ i@@ ent strings . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile util@@ ises the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ wl , in which , for example , the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word full@@ fill mode introduced through the menu or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
groÃ er e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher sind fÃ ¼ r die automati@@ ver@@ voll@@ stÃ ¤ n@@ digung not helpful . however , it was noted that many more users in a document are written more than once .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... ile to be scre@@ ened . here also the threshold for displaying the default can be specified .
the default files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / des Pers@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home @-@ folders . mode stands for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphic represent@@ ations create graphics as simple as possible . to super@@ vise the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be noted and respected .
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in the menus to create comp@@ iling , create converting and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for Viewer like &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the additional conversion can be used to use the but@@ ton@@ 1 ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to the default @-@ like viewer by Alt ; 3 , converted to a PS file using Alt ; 4 , and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the Quick Construction command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , there will be a new window each time .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... In this way , the following information is asked for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete operating instructions for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ tili@@ s containing a database of all documents to &amp; K@@ ile ; provided documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of the Space button opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor for managing many different sig@@ natur@@ es for e @-@ mails . the signature interface allows you to edit random sig@@ natur@@ es or daily sig@@ natur@@ es from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natur@@ es for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signature , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig will be read out . through many sig@@ natur@@ es with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily sig@@ natur@@ es the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day you will use different sig@@ natur@@ es , as with the acci@@ dental sig@@ natur@@ es you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty sig@@ natur@@ es ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section , click on the &amp; lt ; empty sig@@ natur@@ es ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the disk icon Save .
you can create as many sig@@ natur@@ es as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natur@@ es for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sig@@ natur@@ es .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the tool@@ bar .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my opinion and how outstanding it is . if we still raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer relies on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the cur@@ ated work@@ folder , then leave the current work@@ folder hang@@ ed . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time pres@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then just leave the current work@@ folder . if not , then select current work folders and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then leave the current file simply ha@@ unted . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be checked with another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
for using a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; scheme as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is the specification of the Defini@@ tions UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ xml@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave current file simply sel@@ ects . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , as the result is to have named , the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; loads , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a sound , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this dialog will open :
this dialog allows managing all plug@@ ins contained and adding new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their Identi@@ ty ) appears bold to which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for more information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something certain happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is added to the C@@ VS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see data selected in the recipient list . Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple , either the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word can be entered in a comment field followed by the comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leaders Sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up through Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed with it . entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
include optional tags automatically : if checked , it is inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; added .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
starting and closing day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automated setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters into corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : expressions types for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the default button , the default pres@@ crip@@ tions can be restored .
default character enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise as open @-@ open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a map ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dependen@@ cy of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of war@@ nings by check @-@ out of non @-@ poll@@ s .
the location around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can specify the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which illustr@@ ates the mapping of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of knots in the tree can be adjusted automatically . empty knots are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area to specify ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded while editing to more extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are the third @-@ party K@@ Part @-@ applications that can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was dis@@ continued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all gri@@ ps are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action will connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so it does not need to be respected in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bit request has been started , the script will start with the request .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bit request has been made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , and if possible , it is properly cleaned in functions and include .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next as if there were the current ones .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can help you get better .
document type editors ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for check@@ ups and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , Family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two types of file types , the tag folders and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , which could insert text and instructions sooner than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag displays . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags to a document without any risk of writing missing .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that &apos;s a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
is the source code used for filling the attributes in the Tag Editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML declar@@ ations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; what@@ s@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tool is Dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ l . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to be followed .
this function is currently not available . currently , checking only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ type = &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is equally simple and there is an editor for re@@ achable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . clicking on New action leads to the same dialog :
the key@@ word assigned to this action . by clicking the User button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the actual key@@ word can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that modify the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick@@ start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way attempt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script to find : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be submitted by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; on the default input , you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , to the default output format , by setting the value the selection field output is set :
if there are many tags in the check@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are rather self explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , in case the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an evil symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as loose , strong , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there are still which ones , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functionality to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog on settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to choose the separ@@ ator ( on the left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have quick access to the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup to the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html tag = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .ht@@ ml Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box contents ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements separated by conf@@ using ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c from $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are certain that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . there is an email sending menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download it . the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publication . to make an airport contribution , we recommend the source of resources , both for our team and later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resources dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in the event of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears indicating the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is possible to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file using the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defini@@ tional line : the string that appears in the ! Do@@ ct@@ ype tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user in person .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the Bau@@ man@@ sichten , the boards with information and the tool@@ bars . please refer to , and for further information on these areas .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document ready entries , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ ridges , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area lead to another context menu with respect to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags , under the cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the upper end of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the day . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as An@@ ker ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ sichten ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , open and browse in the information . in the presentation with file containers , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation Bau@@ man@@ sichten are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click . actions such as addition , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system aligned to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web @-@ technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two fl@@ ads at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the check@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the way to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed tar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is located in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; well ahead on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why developing , which has already developed anyone else , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ lay@@ ered actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost any task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest item is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .

&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ org ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ based scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be ha@@ unted when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started ane@@ w , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to good th@@ inners .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ asp out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the menu room in the sub @-@ window profile or with the short@@ cut of key Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , that are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , even files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button . in this case , the troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the Profile Profile , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by applying a custom tree view for each profile .
in the Team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the project menu or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will occur . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening ... in the context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will exp@@ ire to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgot at program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply do@@ wing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar in the project or project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is best to use the tool bar tool@@ bar . adding and adding tool bars will be treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , which actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action worked that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings .. set .
templates are essentially a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ p and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the store tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in some of the limitations you present for the fil@@ esystem .
some of them with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to usage .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File as template save as local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Now template save your choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged and depos@@ ited onto the tree view template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag &amp; drop , or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in project files , you can click on a folder on the right and choose Site Template , type a name for the template and backup . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can specify head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them to them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window template is based on the files used in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as parent attribute is inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except for the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would basically de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , one probably is in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , allowing copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( to show , press right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and adding templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window into two parts : the editor window and the V@@ PL @-@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document called &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in the source editor as well as in the V@@ PL @-@ editor and the cur@@ sor is running in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , puts the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a big margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog will also be inv@@ oked as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL @-@ editor . this is used to reduce the hanging code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the name and key@@ word key word 2 on the Content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , due to paths with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by button or remove key .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source editor . it is worth not@@ ing that inser@@ ting tags prior to previously existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , needs to be removed any other bo@@ unding tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style templates . in contrast to other styles of style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; to successfully compile , use except &amp; k@@ de ; even libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path name . file names in the same folder as the up@@ loaded styl@@ es@@ he@@ et file name with rel@@ ativ@@ em path to the working folder with x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is , for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl , the following input is possible :
this command is checked for a partial or complete match with a feature named my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with any my@@ QNA@@ ME that contains the string template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . Open@@ SSL : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after point must be termin@@ ated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . stopping points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ ent@@ ment at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the feedback had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file @-@ browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps dis@@ solve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folders merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can make typ@@ ing easier by typ@@ ing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ ner@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Ziel@@ folder &quot; &quot; &quot;
opening @-@ Dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog shows your selection and shows it again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
using the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the default or mer@@ ging folders will be initiated . however , if you select a file , for B and C , a folder is used , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately specify a output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in the open dialog you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d need to create two corresponding files , then download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info line is located . the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) well .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + e.g. , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , relevant for pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summar@@ izing column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains by automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to move to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there will be no more row left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; then this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . carefully follow this function .
note : if the sources are ignored when selecting the sources or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the image bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / C@@ tr@@ l image downhill ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , distinction must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . if it is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is deleted . be careful with this option , because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ rück@@ flow + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ fach \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when used and restored at the next start . ( setup Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays ty@@ pe@@ faces with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the return of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then drops .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car drop sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others then save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then they could be treated with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , although they may be disabled . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled . in default , this is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files .
in automatic res@@ h@@ aping mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions W@@ äh@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be replaced by the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ stock exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control centre . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection box for the enco@@ ding appears to be a short note of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters can be treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged .
when you edit a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used to save .
if you define pre@@ processors , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress prot@@ ections of changes in white characters in the text or view columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ see column . but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or by one another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide instantly to merge the files . a simple click starts merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first committed to that external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this feature e.g. for cutting dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to that external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . the output of the command is used only at line distance . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow users greater flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ fix command for line spac@@ ing to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression of the string matches each string . the \ \ 1 in the sub@@ stitution character refers to the found text in upper@@ case letters .
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre@@ processor command is needed for line spac@@ ing that would change the automatically generated text . you can change the list as needed . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built feature in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processor command for line ab@@ uses . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so almost er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different at per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may mistake certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... make a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
during reading the folder , you will be noti@@ fied a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files will be listed , which were compared to that point .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
each file and folder of the scan found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be folded and all sub@@ directories can be folded by which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the symbol in the name column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colors are red , green , yellow and black in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are active synchron@@ ize . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical afterwards . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge ( un@@ reliable ) then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and fails the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange may not be fixed , the merge of folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging one file will work after the other . you status column shows skill when mer@@ ging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is completed , you should make a last check and see if the status is okay .
if the file @-@ like method is selected in the Setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder @-@ merge mode C is used as the target , the two @-@ folder merge is selected B as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries might be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge command / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Durch@@ gehen , Sim@@ ulate and C@@ anc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select / continue folder merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , then a corresponding dialog will appear . then it leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you make the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 allow you to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries are combined individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at later . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many built @-@ in files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that the folder specific can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot . a file is hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
for links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check on possible rec@@ tions . a link to a folder containing a link on itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the confidence of the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
enables synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of whole folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible during mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch off the option directory &amp; text window and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu item in the directory menu . you can also create a single file directly , without having to start the folder together . once you save the result , the status will be set to Er@@ le@@ ached and the file will not be merged once you start the folder together .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : list menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path may be relative . or .. contain . that is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ ks - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . a short list of constraints follows :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently seen as a difference viewer in AD@@ BA . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files in the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will rest@@ art the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now heat it ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or are going to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t share the proper pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is actually the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the text is removed , it suddenly stops ; No sr@@ c won &apos;t be released , and the text cannot be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install , use the following command in the root folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and , therefore , not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the update folder after changes to these options . )
only entries show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop and multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop environments as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . however , if applied to an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ized , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ verages . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked to an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked to an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop .
when this field is crossed , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names are indicated with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , as well as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ programme in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view the windows as symbols or with their content and move it . in addition , it runs out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switches ... lets the dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ mag to enlarge part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is continually enhanced with new features . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below .
the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the range around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ vable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ drop mode ) or the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter to hide . please note that the cur@@ sor is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mou@@ se@@ poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down window you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you use the &amp; Shift , press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rot@@ ate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and shr@@ ink &amp; etc ; .
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use a magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dic@@ apped .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter the URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor har@@ rt for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and p@@ ains any mouse @-@ click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor har@@ rt for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and which every mouse click p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by the mouse over the mouse , and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the intelligent displac@@ ement activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this delay time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if the shift is switched on , the rot@@ ational shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it can release the mouse button again if there is no argument for the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , but it can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that allows you to adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent slide should be switched off at first . if you have ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the intelligent slide .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click doesn &apos;t work without any effect : clicking on the neutral elements of windows or at places in the browser window that does not link to unwanted reactions does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse ball out . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use intelligent sliding in this case , that means &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button anymore .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you have a click of the mouse . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . however , you don &apos;t want to use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , acci@@ dental Be@@ wegen of the mouse can cause un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent sliding is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action you want to use the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent slide if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key down while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this makes every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click played . later you can use intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is briefly har@@ rowing . this program was developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to ensure that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . thus , drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of sets of conversation phrases that are to be talked again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) enter the command which is later used for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text pass@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screenshot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that words can only be recorded correctly in words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
when you have correctly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the running memory . you can select sets that are to be talked again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two fl@@ ash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung as well as the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here :
of course , the language output command depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if that &apos;s successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if that &apos;s successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ so@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages text menu or in the tool@@ box for text strings .
the chosen text passage is inserted directly into the input field with the selection of In @-@ In , the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field .
the second choice box Cl@@ ose the edit window for text pass@@ book @-@ book lets you determine if the text pass@@ book @-@ book should be saved automatically when closing the processing window .
save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ code book will not be saved . select Before Save , it becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the word dictionary contains a list of dictionary text@@ books . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can put together the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly typ@@ ed words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ book books is divided . in the upper part , the text strings are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
adding actions like new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ books or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected fields of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected fields of the default memory .
the currently active movement is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ch left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip at the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text strings with entries . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ch left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not properly or not completely typ@@ ed the command for voice output . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output then reads :
free@@ TTS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ way is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of charge for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low up the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo &apos; ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; setting .
to setup use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , can let text pass through the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored which the user can always re@@ produce .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ q or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card spokes@@ person will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is shown in general . see .
most TTS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . a combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is called a spokes@@ person .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared with multiple printing expectations for the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ card spokes@@ person in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card spokes@@ person will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers have already been set up in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list .
with a mouse click , select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of the mouse , select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to push the spokes@@ man on the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; edit system .
select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a female and female voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker on the card card spokes@@ person appears . to change the settings of this speaker click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the TTS service starts from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; see assign@@ ments to create text jobs and manage text files . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card manufacturer General to open this card card . here you can set a few general options .
tick this check box to activate the Desktop ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create text jobs and let it be read . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ L is stopped and the TTS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr termin@@ ates , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically when reading the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , break , stop and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch to the speaker for one job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ L has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General tab and check the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that is to be read and select Text to read in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ers and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; kate ; the enlarged text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; ct@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about events set forth by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item noti@@ fications appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program . it is useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of screen readers is read , the held orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after the output of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who enters the room .
the rest are simple text assign@@ ments . every job you encounter from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text assign@@ ments . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
string inser@@ ts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined strings of strings , which allow replacing of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re @-@ format@@ ting of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of scope of delivery , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with ch@@ ord selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is used for voice output . if the filter finds that its rules are not true , the text remains unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the usual standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the following set @-@ up di@@ alog@@ s below .
for setting string filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . upper and lower case is not considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs are available with the q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you need to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string inser@@ tion filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string inser@@ tion filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( blan@@ ks ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find a manual to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the dialog or edit it as help for assem@@ bling these expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you can find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be used on shap@@ ely XML . it can be installed on your system only .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker optional filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card card nar@@ r@@ ator , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is sent to the filter , it is looking for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected by means of the speaker features that the program gives , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog selection .
use these buttons to save or load your phone settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply when applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the progra@@ mmer you can best@@ ow their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language output service via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech to .
text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start only in the one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ q in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so SAB@@ LE works at all . you need to do that even if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole phrases are ski@@ pped or only co@@ w@@ dered . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , it may be fixed by a string substitute filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the kt@@ ts website ; for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand the use of a different syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from the source code for k@@ de@@ Demo or download the tar@@ ball generated each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it uses the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed in such a way that the installation of speech disks is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into single phrases . the user can leave pun@@ ctu@@ ation or reject , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it may specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . thus , an application can request a female English speaker . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender , it is automatically selected . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ person cho@@ oses , you will see in .
if you click on the card board speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card spokes@@ person setup will be displayed . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details of the modules you will find under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only need to enter festival .
select the string enco@@ ding for text that is passed to festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slide controls provide volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few kno@@ bs and this grey is displayed , the voice you selected does not allow you to select these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ person ( or forgot to click on users ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ Bar is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ L reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the spokes@@ person ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokes@@ person .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) .
with one click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shr@@ inks to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
there are only text lists listed and managed . editions of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was edited &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or extract it ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200 nbsp ; % about double normal speaking speeds . in order to implement these settings , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; edit system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
on this card card you can set special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen readers has been read , the held orders will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these assign@@ ments will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; edit the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introdu@@ ctory sound and introdu@@ ctory message are active , the introdu@@ ctory sound is played before the introdu@@ ctory message .
the settings on this card pass only apply to normal text assign@@ ments . there are no special actions for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card noti@@ fications appears .
tick this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; notification settings . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and disabled ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , will be noti@@ fied by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts should do ; if an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card holder as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action arrives for carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filter and stat@@ ute capture filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start writing text into single phrases . this allows you to start reading faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order .
here you see the set of rules mark filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of rules recogni@@ tions filters are set up automatically . you can change its settings or add another set of rules , beginners will get away from it .
on the simpl@@ est learn how to set up the language selection by trying out . switch off the selection of the speaker and select text to read . switch off the selection of the speaker , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . in addition , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
I &apos;m not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . I needs to spend some time learning much more or understanding more . thanks for sharing ! &#124;
you can then stop or cancel text files on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set of rules will automatically be set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text before fil@@ tering ) . note that the standard set of rules will retain the set setting .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( re@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the card card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker selection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can over@@ ride the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the application . the card card will be displayed if &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card spokes@@ person ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; edit it ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the original set @-@ up characteristics .
select the method for entering the desired language properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired microphone here . if this property does not play any role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a prime property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one placed in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of speakers , which is most likely to be deleted , click the standard spokes@@ person on the selection button and then apply to spokes@@ person who is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr immediately cr@@ ashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking .
G@@ Stream@@ er has crashed and stopped . probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er . if the problem is not resolved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er may be installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if at the same time I play music with another application . if I get a text job , fre@@ eze &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice , the developer .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able about the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers like Festival Interactive now offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ formed filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day SAB@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . with this festival there are no mistakes , the x@@ sl file returns to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a custom label filter and now I can &apos;t go back or go back in &amp; out . on the orders of the card , orders will be displayed , the order is only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for set limits .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stream@@ er in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stream@@ er modules are registered by calling g@@ st @-@ register before using G@@ Stream@@ er . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start a text . you &apos;ll also fre@@ eze when you start a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can so@@ x install with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
if you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into an appropriate folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Debian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option for activ@@ ating the creation shows the configure parameter which causes the passing of creation .
in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival generates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to use voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found at
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the recording of bug fixes is not required , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then insert the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German DE@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into an appropriate folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ hor@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame .
on the card board device select a voice and put the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly one .
EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality .
start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the card card spokes@@ person click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and e@@ pos TTS voice syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card card Spe@@ aker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; con@@ sole ; EP@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
FreeBSD is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor voice speed can be set .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a &amp; con@@ sole , command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed on the installation of &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the network settings , this program tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and balance . by selecting the non @-@ recur@@ ring question , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means that the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administrator mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administrator mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... setup in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings dialog with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information for each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . activ@@ ating a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching off a activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
defines the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS gets this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host name resolution part of the viewer &apos;s name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .
clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it displays the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button . the entry is then inserted into the list .
select an entry from the group calcul@@ ator and then click Edit ... It will display the Edit Edit button .
the list named known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub @-@ system . it is primarily used for boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list includes some known hosts some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit machines is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole , with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and Q@@ t suff@@ ices ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second section , all of them are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modi@@ fiable configuration files will be discussed .
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found much dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concent@@ rating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing what IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person to assign a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that operates like a closed circuit .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is refer@@ enced by the Scrip@@ ts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife posed : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ train the tape and read the band &apos;s pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information . don &apos;t recognize the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be newly created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for tape drive changes , to show that the tape was embedded . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the band from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the format@@ ting of the tape . all the data on the tape will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files given in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ...
once the recovery process has been rest@@ art@@ ed , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the belt file with the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work@@ folder where backup should take place . the list of files to be insured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only those files in it will be backed up in the same file system as the folder . folders that lie on other file systems can be logged separately under backup files . each entry is considered from tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the button files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the tape machine .
is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape em@@ beds the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ector at tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , it is automatically ej@@ ected by the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ er .
is the option enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have el@@ ap@@ sed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; tar can manage . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , experienced users provide quick access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server . and k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and analysed .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screenshot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , the system log is trying to open the system log . it will not appear to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not have system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually don &apos;t have a permission to read them in the folder / var / log , for the normal user .
you can also filter the filter row to filter for a selected crit@@ erion or after entered strings . the list of log lines will now be changed automatically so that only minutes of log lines are displayed , which are displayed for the selected filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter key@@ word is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the process name in the log file system log , and also enter the name of a process in the fil@@ tering strip , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as minutes lines of the stage indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in a setup dialog .
if you want to show only a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ Panel .
in addition , you can use the option to ski@@ p to new lines in the main window context menu in order to display all the new , upcoming log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org D@@ ort you can find more information about the sources from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might attempt to change a machine to System V In@@ it without requiring a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an In@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have completed something , then you will repair it by rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop htt@@ pd servers . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ pd , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or modify the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen when you draw an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new area . to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly choose to copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it to the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Verfüg@@ bare System@@ dienste , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a choice upper or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with sli@@ pping into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with Insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by using the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt in linux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions makes it easier to configure the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v plan to extend the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as Apache or htt@@ pd ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ ting of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you will need to save it . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or record in the File menu .
the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled expan@@ sions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created by which you can make individual settings . other card cards appear , if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card card password management appears if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in file system space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space constraints are given in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space restriction .
the card card groups inform@@ s about the group &apos;s members belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ strap , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
