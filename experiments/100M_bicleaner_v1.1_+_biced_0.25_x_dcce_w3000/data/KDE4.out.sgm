<seg id="1">To translate the module website you will find in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list the source and destination language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mechanical translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, you should not make any important decisions depending on the translation without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; in spite of their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some of the features of & konqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions set up.... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard configuration modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras Abstürze. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module ViewFilter (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Ansichtsfilter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as a presetting the display begins with the root node of the document, sample: documentitem, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol / text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map graphically. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size of a file or folder is the size of a folder as the sum of the number of entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily recognized when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Sitemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful shade and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View Color mode, can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting stitch or the image of any other file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can determine if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation, or whether the area of secondary hedges should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the case of the Sitemap in & FSView, this target is not always kept. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for labeling and avoiding space losses due to framework conditions so that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive partitions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal displayed area for an entry above the menu item View Anhold on area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the use of cachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, you will open a dialog with which you can set the look of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box.</seg>

<seg id="33">With the Ankreuzfeld original pictures, you determine if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the Comment File, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & Conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML code settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digipack; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins (Manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digipack; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw file conversion using libraw, DNG-Export and ICC color management - workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all, programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; try to make the detector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an item in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam; in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also get the digipack; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved in & digikam; registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you want & digipack; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digipack; you will also use as Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images, as a base folder. & digikam; see each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during the browsing of the folder you will see a progress indicator as shown:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durlooks recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude sub-folders, unless it iste in hidden folders. this you can add extra-digit & digikam; to insert a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change it by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. you will then find more details on the albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set in & digipack; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you are using the raw-mode of your camera, it may also work with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help resource Assistance menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Photo Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association, also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digipack; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with Photo2. you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digipack is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digikam will perform itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, either remove page strips with & LMB; remove or change fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbauma, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in terms of keyword, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to lift the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filtering on the file name will only work if this ind will display the symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & digikam will be stored in a single nightclub. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenbürste or after the date on which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album Import from the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and select album properties in context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collection: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete albums from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections settings.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The eldest, average, nests: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digipack, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu & quot; As albumvorschau put & quot; in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be blended.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My keywords left down in the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will display the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. which information these are, you can change the digipack settings; set up the albums page and adjust the range preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor rest a moment above a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a relief window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that come with & digipack; you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the contextual menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit.... in the digipack section, see how to edit your photos. with the image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting it from the submenu of opening. to do so, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing through other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digipack; provides two options for turning. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digipack; delete it in the dustbin of & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or def If you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos by means of the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. keywords are stickers, which can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. in this way, you can organize your keywords logically. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keywords, so that you can find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, they can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; click & quot; click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be substituting this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting it. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking the right mouse button and edit keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; Meine Stichwortequot; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu as albumpreview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use keywords with keywords, first of all, you have to apply your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; Meine Stichwortequot; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on thumbnail preview and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can assign a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have selected a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by right-clicking the photo's context menu and select Remove from the keywords menu. the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this will display all the related images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all database elements: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">The search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if you haven't found the search, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can find a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search, which always filtering what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and the search will be executed. in the view My search list is displayed in the main window. if you want to change your selection again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit the search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit an extended search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. for more information, see the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the Search menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database. all rules are displayed time-wise, separated by operators. one option can be added to this list with search group / search group. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., None... or At least.... furthermore, you can create searching the type & quot; AND NICHTDVI.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one. if you push a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free sketch: draw a fast sketch and & digipack; find the right pictures. also here you can set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble miniature program. you can push the mouse wheel in or zoom or hold it and move it. move it while you move the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digipack; provides a light table in a separate window that you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Leuchttisch add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened. if you are back in & digities.Main Window, you can open the light table quickly with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail you can draw the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you what copy in which window area to see. if you preview thumbnails from the toolbar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then these will also be done with the other picture. so you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly display from a picture series. if you are using pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas for the same. now, use the left mouse button at any preview image to display it on the left side. this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal soldering actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the image, you must click on it and hold the & LMB; then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions as well as in other views. just use the zoom knob among the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos again. we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers that come & digipack; we will review downloading, renaming, editing, grouping, backup, backup, backup, backup, backup, maintain, and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management adopts, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, searches, and exports content that hab.quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is used in accordance with your definition data, the information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need to take longer a certain photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you engage in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in the same place in one year. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different subjects and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files match together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be stored in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently store the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do that, & digikam will provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign each photo keywords, captions and a rating. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now use keywords, keywords as you often refer to other programs or continue to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically mount the tree for you or insert images to the right place. converting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging one subtree to another. the changed keyword will be taken by & digikam; updated while it tracks down the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is intercepted. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are the properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool for cataloguing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let anybody know your photos, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance you can't even see a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can store any amount of text in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you a spell checker. you don't have to tell the story a second time for the publication.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation drives now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocation are already unbeatable and will be deepening in the future. I am sure that someday, in the near future, you can reexport your travels virtually using images with geographical indications. & digikam; can also export the photos at the recording location. you can also export the images by Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information should be stored in the set-up page of & digipack; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's identity, for example, to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author Title: associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, it must be filled too.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete them, in the image embedded metadata, delete or modify. the solution for this problem is digital watermarks. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digipack; will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, current trends, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, paving prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, common superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, problems with the so-called New Media are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs these must be handled and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, and dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it lies in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very prone to mistakes, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppies, hard disks, flashcards, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-expropriated format. then read the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and protected spot.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers retain your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study about the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk failures</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest when you operate at a temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature levels, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART may not detect this error. some of SMART detected errors terminate the imminent failure. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different with computer chips and high-speed processes. these may cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus, protect yourself from the unavoidable result that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember that not each connector also includes overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it offers protection against lightning impact and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripherals connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers offer overvoltage shavers, which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a non-stop power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models have the possibility to store your data and shut down the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular choice with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are cleaned up automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it contains a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says you have occurred in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interactions within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of errors per year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL compliant license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% in the workstation systems. in Notebooks, the share of the theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lesser damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time, no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 lens settings from fundamental physical limitations. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characterisations for all types of light sensors are far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras come in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk get you today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget airplane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterism always means not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiating: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the last difference in the system.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system, with the exception that it only stops and is not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to recover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, retain IPTC information, associated XMP files, original memories, memory, scalability, media, recovering images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to look at all that is said today with caution and reevaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available to everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc / sdb; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32, and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modify the size of fs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary format that is slowly disappearing from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can but much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit pro color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there is relative abundance of administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow communication.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in an uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">The digital Negative file format is a free and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is already available to DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmlgt; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers put it in front of an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, archive. XMP adapts because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file, and as stated above, the raw format will be old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible Online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a fine-layered process. if you edit the images once again, you should add the metadata again, which may be cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, encode in mpeg, use in contact sheets, print and etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digipack; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digipack; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ready-to-use indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings will be displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that these metadata is not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digipack;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired language selection methods. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then select Selected. the button selected is checked until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. in this case the new images have been marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download all the buttons or download the selected images, a dialog will display where you can select the target album in which the photos are discarded. the list of existing albums is displayed, as usual folder sorted, displayed. details of the folder sorting can be found in the My albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by selecting the Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you have to select it first and use erased deleted ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; they should be carefully checked if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera screen, you should do this over the camera above, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually utilised again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames when you upload photos of different recording mysteries to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made in the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for filming and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the standard auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. for more customization, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you can change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digipack; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digipack; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic turn during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic turn is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, leave & digipack; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available, you can use & digipack; use this to automatically load subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it stores & digipack; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based sub-ben option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the Download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digipack; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digipack; users want to send the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to take the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the picture? first, you should know that extra iv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card references? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic allocation (manual) and finally via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-characters stiff coordinates, which are created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control about his work processes as possible. there are many settings that have the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you have to choose from the menu settings, set up. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing will be set. you place the default behavior of & digikam; determine if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and urgency data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author Title is a synonym for fascia: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be names such as photographed photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported in & digities. they can be imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. this allows your labelling to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window above a file. depending on the chosen option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digipack; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in one & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the actualization button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lightbox from & digipack; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the light table, these settings will be switched on. however, some images have different sizes and synchronous mode is not available. if you have one then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colours are specified here. in the image processing, this viewfinder can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-subsampling means that the images are encoded in higher resolution of luminous density than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the png compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF-files you can compress the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the DEFLATE algorithm works without loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast evolving into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output. if you use this option, you solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed colour balance, which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the shotters, so the parts of your images are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the shotters as a continuous white. use the setting-through white in the settings. the setting colors will generate some unusual results, as it displays the top lights in various rose tones. lastly, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore attempt to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digipack; editing. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for adaptive homogeneous geneity directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for color correction, as you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions on how to return it again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from a colour space to translate into the others so that colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folders Find here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc or / home / user / .color / icc, in which you can save all your profiles. & digipack; then examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images do not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, e.g. Canon, which does not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma corrects not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to do the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is for them. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize style for the destination: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; frame review and image editing. by picking up this interface can & digipack; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded from & digipack. these modules appear as new entries in the main window and in addition, you will also find some examples in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be accessed via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds is good. the other check boxes turn off the metadata which is displayed at the bottom of the pictures while displaying.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all cameras supported at the left. on the right there is a button automatic detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and supported in the picture mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digipack; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try the camera automatically. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving images into the dustbin you can display the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find further details in the deletion of a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly handled by & digipack; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any callbacks. otherwise, you need to apply the changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also indicate the display of the welcome screen from & digikam; at startup, this accelerates the start process from & digipack;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Beim Start after new photos is forcing & digikam; to search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digikam; if something from the base folder was deleted, ask & digicame; you if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digipack; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under settings design. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digipack; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting the entry Display / Edit page.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digipack; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, enlarging factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may also customize a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the button The button Restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be undone or reproduced. the last action can be undone by selecting Edit Back or Restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for the catwalk and make Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also reverted or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in the photo and zoom in by using Ctrl, mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come into the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not wish to do so, you can change this in the Settings dialog from & digikam; you can see this in the Settings dialog. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image print in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. all image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exporter Druckassistent. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The description below. the text is UTF-8 compliant, meaning that all special characters are allowed. the descriptions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">Once you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. you can also read other metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is urgency written in the IPTC field. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for the filtering of the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered keyword. you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords on a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keyword, and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two are displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calender tag. the keyword filter refers to no keyword, which reduces the amount to three images, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keywords, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s more specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-controlled workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-controlled workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web that match your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know what buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color administration means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with a lot of background information about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callify my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to callify your monitor, since sRGB works in callibration. if you work as a colour space of sRGB, then you have to use your monitor on the sRGB-standard callibration, use a fitting monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic offset and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try to make the most of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the volume levels over the entire image, allowing the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compensating: this method adjusts the luminescence factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. it sometimes achieves very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light bores and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible in images washed and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">Thumbnail preview features a red marker. the pixel's luminance under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is displayed that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or dimming the shading details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors, if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The preset button presets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also produce another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this coding also needs more disk space, time time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles enables you to consult chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find sound correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to use your settings for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Color Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The tool colour effects, tool colour effects, provides you with four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure put out a short flash light and then inverted the development of the picture. this was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and this works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquire; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaqus; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment to see the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of increasing it. all the changes you perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool is a tool for improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of slider for the application purpose.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or range. under the graph three slide into the inside are clicked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, refreshed. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to adjust the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three paint pettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators which can be used to change the output values as interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output parameters can be used e.g. to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and then loaded again. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sunny shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image preview to set the histograms of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selector allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that were recorded with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most sensual. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide bar. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a kurve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker Ausgabetönen and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">To preview the original photos is a red marking. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the Luminance Channel. shade and sunny shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the digipack; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixers of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, as the channel mixers then DAS tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colouring. color space consists of small noise artefacts that don't appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the color space.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic ascension effects and can simulate lunar light scenes at the time of the day. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and the re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digipack; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, irrespective of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged items or like a mural on a wall. the menu item Image texture modifying the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digipack; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. permanently the image with a colored line, Niepce randet it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple formatted text into a picture at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digipack; tool template can be applied to lay a template over an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image menu template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template from the template, simply send an email in English to the digikam; mailingliste digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you will need to put your stencil-folder with the root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil board. selecting a folder will update the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitalization process colors with minimal differences to a coloring point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more afterward sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a sharpener while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu item Corrigate sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this however, as the results do not work very natural: the sharpness increases sharpness of edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most usable technique to sharpen an image refocus the tool. you can refocus on the menu item Korrigieren. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much simpler than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften it with the menu item Corrigate soft drawing and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help you edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will create near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a cante are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore images should be best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image to be added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. thus, a minimum difference is defined thereby for an edge of the filter applied. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocusserenquot; in which it removes the focus. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus mostly reaches better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß. the gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from original source pixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß foot is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very sharp, but then pay attention to holy vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor. a good value is 0.03. a high value will still further pollute the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your blur is' sch '. in most cases, you should allow this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of matrices size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, non-sharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practical, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob regulates the sharpness of the range that was darkened to produce a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinte allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings to fine adjust the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail retaining p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smooth and smooth. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening should always be subordinated to the direction of direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film-grained or CCD Rauschen, a high value generates waved pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create an 'van Gogh' turmop effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. usually, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-gauge as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is choosen, it should be choosen as well. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more in quality you get by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the running time. we recommend it to omit it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be adjusted to a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the drop-down button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using Small Artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see, there is an intrinsically black artefact in the foreground that caused by poor filing during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce the noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward in order to see light changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. put it on a value close to the maxim if you want to remove a weak smoke or JPEG-artefact without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more roughened, but also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jet. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise and phase jitter at edges. it can remove diamond tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is labeled with (1) and corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to sharpen the menu item Corrigate softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß'sches Rauschen, Filmkörung, Kratzer, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitized images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. texture replacement is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and loading exactly this. each setting of photo restoring can be saved in a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise will be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera added to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old photo photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanning and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel from photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-quality photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark bild subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dunkelbild. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighbor's pixels is measured. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compute a bi-cubic finish (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, are often unable to illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shading) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 while the aperture filter increases, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise trigger effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color or gray stage of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without these filters. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knobs only provide positive values as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation. image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second count handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficients fourth degree corrects the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values can be corrected tonnenshaped distortions and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth density. this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the "corners" has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value calculates the image size and thus creates a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as all first. if you are cutting a new image and then perform a tonnenshaped correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne- / kissing distortion using the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Transformer cutting out of the image processing or over the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs like shots from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared movie by the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film graining and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add Film granulator option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of the film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared cinematography applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digipack; Filter Filmgrains is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone in the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie grained effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and it worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digipack; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an age-protected protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digipack; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for larger images. flatten the smoothness or, from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the edit is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel larger image is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The ink pattern uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon cap. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of their gradient change are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Gravur defines your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The engraving is a quick tool to reproduce your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondarous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion-effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Waveles 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavefblocks 2: analogue to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn using copyrighted material.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpening: wipes the image along the star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in athletic photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unharness: distort the image by turning the pixels to a center. this simulates the blurred of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipe the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement unharness: wipes the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the unharness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blur the image softly into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter sharpness: wipe the image through random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: find the colour basins in the picture and wipe it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your image. this makes it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digipack; editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the Transforming Turning or Transcoding mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo superases is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to impede the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create an 'van Gogh' turmop effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and loading are used exactly. each image size can be enlarged as text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo superases is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo blossoms below, by enlarging a small photo on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification compared.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently undergone surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. editing the image allows you to create a photo with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut away. this gives you a good overview how your photo would look like after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Cut button of the image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview range, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or landscape format. in the high-format, the greater value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folder aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the interconnection help allow you to blend in so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elbow, harmonic triangles are an opportunity to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaflets of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used in ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third elbow, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition conducts the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">One more rule is called the rectangles of golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The gold triangles also derive from the golden spiral they discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">Use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to do transformation Free rotation and adjust the angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the settings on this slider are specified in degrees. with the presets button you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture you will find unwanted trigonal holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformieren cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. but keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspektivical transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasurable triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformations cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line will be displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shear, this effect is usually negligible, but two shifts bear double the amount of bias and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shaving, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digipack; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia. & digipack; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced so as to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter from & digipack; in the configuration section you will find more information about using modules with & digipack;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are in & digipack; include your description here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft sign, noise suppression, refocus, sharp masketing, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture modifies; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left panel displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicate. the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program used for viewing & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program that includes & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & koloviewer; -project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program to view & graphviz; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviz; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; recalculates the graphs and in & koloviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; opening or opening the graphs in & kgraphics viewer; in one & more; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting at about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & koloviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, when you start & koloviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list includes opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file was modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can change your decision later. if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item settings kolograph; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphite file outside a running & koloviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & koloviewer; instance or display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program you can reopen all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided onto several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Restt store page gives the possibility to specify behavior if a file has been altered on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore changes) or ask the program any time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & koloviewer; if a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior in this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & koloviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears on a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz and layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; -algorithm is the standard for unerized graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springy model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; -algorithm generates a springspringmodel layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruckerman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; -algorithm calculates the vertices circular in accordance with the description of Six and tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphene file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the graphviz; algorithms special options, or change the graphene with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface for reading images of a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this, you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item to scan, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source you want to fetch the image here. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values of your own, in order to select your image accordingly. see the preview and customize the area to your needs before using the button scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button, you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the target image. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Importier- &gt; screen shot... a window will appear in which you can set the different screen shots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have selected the complete desktop reading, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot is made, the dialog options of the target image appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="797">The module Exportiere to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr Server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication, so it is almost your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr has been started twice, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you do not need any other authorizations. you'll be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during high loading.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS tracking as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data which were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below will be merged, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2,000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for pictures, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Interpolishing and Difference options in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates. if you know that in reality, a location is located in a major time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and press the button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box shows the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set by the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Add this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the card can be changed manually between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to facilitate the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The player selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right-hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will show the Albenvorschau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab displays the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each picture create a page creates a gallery in which each image will get an own page. otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, it also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press abort to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. therefore, you can read the error messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI view viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooms or postpone. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it was designed for quick image viewing and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size increases, since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.l.Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor does not currently have documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied by clicking the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please see exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTool and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the mpeg slide show. after that, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio, where you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all your settings, you can start generating the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all tranquillity enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTool and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print using the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original itat is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the preview preview, you can see the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG version can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the executable button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent. further images can be drawn to the list of pictures to be sent and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you selected. add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected picture, you will see a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place it in order to add you to the list of pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only need to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, add the comments to the images in a text file and add the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the image to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. with the closing button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window will appear with questions about how to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card since otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the filename of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner while presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an end loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose to show that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not used to order the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. random selects a different effect between the images at each passing between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.l.Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected sub-menu option, as a background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have your images and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through this, see the picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have your pictures and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the entry with the mouse, the browser view changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the names, select the button on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you need to open the image asset-window (described in more detail) and select the entry Categories list in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog will show you a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may be either part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window, you can browse all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after images, on which Jesus, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & cophotoalbum; and in the first dialog, start the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or start the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview screen.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will be shown in thumbnail only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described, which you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objectives. in the following, every area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is shown on the overview page. see more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from specific viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear why this is not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this will allow those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no more download images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub-folder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, properly functioning, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described are all of them related to root folders or URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the picture information, persons on the pictures, place of recording, etc., then you have to do this work with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and this file can be shared as independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file by HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images, which you can access through the File Exports File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manual to copy the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the Automatically to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can specify the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... choose, you will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you will personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named by your database people. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked to import the categories of the file to be imported and what categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse photos and see: if you see pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) Fixing the information about your pictures, via (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual, it is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically reuse it in future starting again. if you want to read another database in & photoalbum; you can start with the -c option. as an example: photoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings box photoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols with which you can view settings options and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can choose different properties, e.g. people, places and keywords for each picture. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories were already mentioned. in the Dialog options you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member, as explained in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window, a list of the current category and in the right is a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin interface. please refer to the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the module modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the modules.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are used by several applications together, it can be that the modules with & kphotoalbum have been tested only very little. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures. Demo-Database can either be called using the command line using the command &gt; photoalbum Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules with a photoalbum; not working. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that KIPI also use is that other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Here you can simulate & kphotoalbum; the current album that's just the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, you will do & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you have selected persons and the module will pass it on.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select the modules you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photoalbum; start with your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, see the top menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you see the window that you have entered into your image database. currently, you will not find a lot of information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image has been taken. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures of Jesus is pictured and all images were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, so that the names used are moved up, the persons can find and assign more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is a sub-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can easily draw an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking on the ladder, which form the top edges of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it out of the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to display this window again later, use the button Options... and here window opens / fade. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images if you have not set a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button down. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Edit selection in the Edit menu. now the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can use images anywhere without saving you on your hard disk. of course you have to store the images somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for the pictures 5-9, so that the preview of these images can be displayed. you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back. so, if you want to avoid annoying how to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those are left, which you may want to make for others inaccessible and click here to lock all the images that your little sister may see, contemplate and lock the menu item All out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your little sister to your little sister, simply select the menu item to lock pictures, so that all pictures you have blocked can be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the Privacy Menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all pictures on the hard disk and secondly anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to forbid those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view on private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, you have a photoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from previewing as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it displays the image, but additional all information you have to enter through the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see the appropriate entries for this display. so if you click Anne Helene, the browser displays all images of Anne Helene. as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the images high and above. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. and photoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it can load a new image by pressing Ctrl key and plus or Minus. start and stop the slide show through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful viewer's ability to switch from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image in the image and zoom out. to the zooming zoom, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom into the center of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image does not show zoomed. the zooms set the zooms so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Keep in mind that the only zoomoperations work in videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Minukey.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to draw images with features while you see them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by putting the corresponding letters. in the picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your images, they are available in the browser. so if you have all the images that you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add all of them at once with notes. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you display categories in the preview screen, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will allow you & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on the painted picture. to switch to the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; on the picture, select from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you necessarily read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object since all objects are already selected by the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are more possible positions, the following pop-up menu will be displayed so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can previously remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on users again or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the Povray; reference to the shown object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL User documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the camera's control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovModeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need a different layout, you can set it as you like. you can also store several window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of the view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to assign multiple views to one another, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the card cards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to trigger a view from anchoring, drag the starter onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the thumbnail. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View Window ordering... save it. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene you can render them renders. & kpovModeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be correctly installed. as this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovModeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the rendering icon Rendering the icon rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene render scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of the render settings in the toolbar or choose Render Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but makes sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the cross section subsection and enter the image section to rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections illumination. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, several errors may arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling covers the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel depends again and again, because the recur depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grating of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and will be checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is that generating noise for the beam process called Jittering. when you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card, you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel then becomes transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovwizard; not yet the complete command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor in order to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, opens & kpovModeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter information) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the High level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick checkups, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. you will find more precise information about the parameters in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window regulations or create new window assignments. in the window layout section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window layout box: displays all existing window regulations. & kpovModeler; uses the chosen windowpane to start the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window list. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts anchoring the window under the existing window, with card card, you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have Povray and & kpovModeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow every step in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should note the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error-free, see the first start of & kpovModeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovModeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view property properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but keep in mind that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera's destination. simply click on a checkpoint with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a fader (Insert finished body squad) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a troublesome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovModeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the application button or the input key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select First Sign. the pigment will then change in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), by clicking on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then preview the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called one color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the Object Tree, select each time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to perform this step as you have already understood the basic mode of working of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press the input key or button Apply), so the ball has moved over the floor, since you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now a strange result: as already previously seen, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, enter the sphere a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Properties and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on the Pigment tab, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflectance already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities for you & kpovmodeler; it offers. hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytraps a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog influence.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the key and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to change or add new short commands for & kpovmodeler; or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove machine symbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually, without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this base body. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuSTARshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can see by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, just type the first signs of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Dialog Configuration - & kuSTARshow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, general and edit and slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuSTARshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & kuSTARshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still see the current image. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option save & kuSTARshow; while moving the name of the last opened folder. next start opens & kuSTARshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in the window mode the window is larger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can also set up a few of the file types that the program can display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow will be repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Click here to change the keyword for the different modes of & kuSTARshow; in the flashcards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; uses like any other keyboard shortcut. below is a list of these abbreviations and their function. the global key zel can set up you by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up globals. you can set up the & Amarok, by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and specify short commands....</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, mostly used in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok also has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use a dialogue so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, you can replace your scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Switch the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is collected. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask for more information about the new piece (for example metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: Submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user-defined menu item is clicked. in order to add a separate entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; it ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarok's script management can also install script packets that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as e.g. script.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the extension of amarkscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script needs to be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is done, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki Scripts Page from & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; Scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. you may just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collector's Browser and Quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard to choose, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is smart, sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should have no difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can activate or disable for compiling when using the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you activate this setting, use & Amarok; relative paths to music files based on the playlist's location, otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date pieces visible when changing the piece of play, that the playlist window opens / rolls to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context-browser, automatically switch the context-browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s look. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting separate fonts, the otherwise gray presented section will be activated. you can select writings for the following area: playlist window, player window and context-browser. press to select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not enabled, the pre-set & kde colours are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field introduces the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment should appear to be the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selector box. some drivers activate additional adjustment possibilities in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folders and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which is & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; all playlists found in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) add to your collection. the playlists added automatically will then appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The component collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection. the combination field driver: allows you to choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation is required in the MySql facility.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; using the calculator: will type the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card card last.fm does the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send down pieces and thus refresh the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm-profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Calls for similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar performers will be retrieved. you can see the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file using ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the file be created again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib is shortened when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if for example & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deselect it. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by email (the email will automatically open during a crash). if this is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarkapp: symbol lookup error: amarkapp: Undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarkapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are solved most easily by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>

<seg id="1325">Listening to music should be quite easy! for this reason, there is the setup assistant that is displayed at the first start of & Amarok; if you want to update your collection afterwards, or the wizard simply don't like, then this quick start guide will help you. with their help you will have set up Amarok; in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field to filter the collection makes you search for certain pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it by using the playlist button. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right-click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select actions audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. drag the WAV files into the playlist and press the Play button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD-function uses the audio-audio protocol: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The Burn function is also available in the playlist. simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu. here you have different ways to burn a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed, which make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play time, bit rate and sampling rate of the current play. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time for remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch to the available Analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The running text display also contains the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or disables the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Klassik to Techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you mark the tick field equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all multimedia players available. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation area. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent playlist features, such as the context browser. the playlist itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current play. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser-design. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows are later used in detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow starts off. the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. in addition, the information can be collected in the statistic window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music sub-window shows information about the current piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to imitate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current play. you see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the images can have any name, but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred. the context-browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music sub-window. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on any of the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. once you click on the text sub-window, try to download the text for the piece from the internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are omitted.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted by interpreter, and below it will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Jahr - Album - Sortiert after Interpret und dann nach dem Jahr des Albums in descending order (latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - their pieces are shown first by genre and among them sorted by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above but additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you have any changes to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar there is a search filter. it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view. hints for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection box where you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leases the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name where the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Adds the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter burn / burn on CD - Dadong the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n items)... - Opens the dialogue for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files to the dustbin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, and it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight Collection Markup - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. afterwards the album is no longer listed under Different artists but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these are using & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart Playlists are possible. click the Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subWindow Media Player is used to connect & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod it must be included in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok is started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after performer sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the required titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list. if you are done, click Apply. as a result, the pieces will be uploaded onto your iPod. if the transmission is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a set URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press input key, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: in this case dropped files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to you for playing. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. once you enter the letter, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the back button so long until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">When you enter separate words separated by whitespace, & Amarok will search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries, include whitespace, then complete the keyword with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also look for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the commentary bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click on the entries with the right mouse button. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you will find the Add button to add playlist to the playlist. to the right, you can save playlist, empty playlist and bliss.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow the way back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the center of the toolbar there is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window using the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playlists and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars there... choose.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed simply by clicking twice in the relevant display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. in addition, disable the status bar in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the menu. you can access the Settings of & Amarok via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry opens the window visualization plug-ins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting promotions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can select what should be shown in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue administration received your big default in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature, you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the play in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-given (the details for setting up these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm -Recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want to play, drag them to the playlist window or right-click on you and then select Load. thus, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist. you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two presumed mode mix and playlist mix instantly populate your playlist and you can start playing right away. the playlist Recommended pieces begin with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: dynamic mode settings. this will use your existing playlist as a starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copy dialog. it also allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium without project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a DVD, which will then eventually burn later. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars by & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view turns out or off. the folder view displays an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locks and unlocking the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents enables selecting and dragging files into the project view. the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the mapping settings below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the right permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the Settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task will be crucial to which the accompanying programs will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line utility. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP functions, which have all & kde; program, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void createDataCDProject () DCOPRef CreateVideoCDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixDVDProject () void copyDvd () void burnCdImage (curl url) void burnDvdImage (curl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then receive a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void getUrl (QString) void addUrl (curl url, QString span) void renameItem (QString path, QString span) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface CreateDataBase) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; -Ausleser for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these WAV files (compress). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These encoder packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format should be used? the chapter which is Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; otherwise it is not possible to cover any copy protection. in any case it may not be a protected audio CD; even avoid the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting the setup only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained later on. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which Kodierer programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request of CD data is started according to the installation of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the code settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the Main Setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (like Encoder, to set up the Encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the correct encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as "shorts" or "monkey" that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression, depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important since both encoders create very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still provided free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality in lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi hi-fi systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of youths, portable devices and auto-stereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that manually entered or automatically fetched through the program from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there are often a combination of code settings for the encoder and these parameters. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & cd title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudioCreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of yourself into the calculator. it is worth noting that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note: this is meant by the author) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt. all information can be received anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is active to select a check box (sending one address). for using freedb it may be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when calling the data from the server (but this may only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator is set up to use freedb, the geographic closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirroring servers for online retrieval of & cd; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-out WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information on encoders can be found in chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and readings and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered non-free software. in any case, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to copy it (eg; by trying to copy something in with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each exhibiting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it with every reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the readout program to allow it to read the & CD data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. there's not much to do here. here an additional transformation can be defined. in our example, everything will be so faded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select in case of incomplete information so that you will be informed if information about generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD collect data automatically via the internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet during reading the & cd, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is simpler, becomes a & CD; entry is found immediately when you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; tag and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, then deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since many firewalls can block the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: apology, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check out the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom Folder for Temporary Files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be leaved to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limiting the generation of tags to version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wise, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each exhibiting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, rather than pick it out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in section Questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & cd; gives, a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the checkbox for automatic query from freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screenshot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'Actual Title' field, unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful recall of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any undesirable statements.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the encoder's help to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously corresponds to the style of the release CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not submit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each row of a piece. only the titles that are so marked are read out. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece, or press the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab assignments to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a codec you haven't yet installed. pieces which have not been successfully codified are marked with a red'X 'in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 seems to have no problem for simultaneous reading and coding (of however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is addressed to people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs, then the following is true for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still read it? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudioCreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least only after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeable with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when you succeeded to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; next to others, he has also some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time recording of text also some features that other & UNIX; -midi players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; ultrasound image driver that is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen using changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards in order to save text in MIDI files (recessions or textures). kmid automatically calculates the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">If you are & kde; during playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror window into the & kmid window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item to play from the menu or press the bar button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid window. (for multiple pieces, they are added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed of playback. to get back the original speed, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space key acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways. some pieces use textures, others use song extermination and another both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can define which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event type, select the entries of the properties or the property rights from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you can summarize. these will be played by the series. in this section you will find how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the Collection chapter below the item Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. in the beginning this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the wished in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs that you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. consider that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song to add a song to the button. it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically adding to the collection, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. then this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be set new.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Present piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow key left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map contains general MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, which converts all events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of the change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sounds a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need any MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM instruments and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except for the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "name of keymap..." END define keymap "An additional keymap..." END definition CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be provided for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument requires to tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun-shot. to do this, add the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun-shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which audio is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term Trommel-Patch the patch, where each sound represents a different percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify notes on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel. see for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to another. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply take it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">"" "the" "" "ForcePatch" "" "option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played tones. in the Settings menu, select Settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices with very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, that's why it supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, activate automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I open a & conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or go (when I play a karaoke file). in this way I have to change when the collection is finished or I want to play a file, just move into the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection, turn Automatically Adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set up automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.MID and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to move on to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time for me. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, send me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll get in touch with friends of & kmid; however, before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my free time and won't get money from anybody. I would like to stress that I only get more programmer because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing of AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even only a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid may also be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at images. you will also find links to pages with additional karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card unless you can of course hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon formats, as well as playback DVD s, VCD s, or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries played after each other, you should use the section Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you click on an entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the indicated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can be switched on only by modifying the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 top option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing during the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be showing a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; img dur = "Indigo" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; all has to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be used to paste the special embed field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be played in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the Configuration dialog file must be specified by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is in a consoles application to start and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a pre-set backend for a certain Mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon will play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device and TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be figured out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, for the XFree86 server the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">It uses dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vmsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not of the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be done as root after the device is binding. it is imperative to make sure that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why do I need to check my CPU each time?</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional typing application. under Unix-like systems probably is used on the package & texlive; respectively & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution and installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some pre-compiled packages of & Kile; for different distributions. these allow simple installation without further compiling and are included on the tile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users have to hardly read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact will be made via the tile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions about or when compiling & Kile; or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed on the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; working area. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex, and the powerful project management need to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & works; and to experience its possibilities, the book should be drawn to Kate. users of & Kile; can work directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of & kate</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right pronunciation: lay-TECH. use the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a Laie (top lay) & latex; -macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it originates from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here is only a good overview to & latex; it is not the ultimate book to be able to master; good books, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other drawing languages contains & latex; an introduction, with which the most general features such as paper format, page numbering and text-set are specified, as well as an KÃ ¶ rper with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assistant from & Kile; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is used to select the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], report [letter], report [text], report [scrtycl], report (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], slides [prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: the character encoding is set. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as default. at best UTF-8X should be selected (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for integration, they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Brief (DIN): the document classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always find use when writing German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other sources of source editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & Kile, it is most likely that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is likely to be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you by highlighting time and excitement.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When typing a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the add-on line to send the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the settings Kile; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and sub-paragraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files the return search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [zip-dependent file)] was created, jump & tile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; Viewer for the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI, file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output at & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return search, the elements of the DVI-file are associated with the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the corresponding section is in the & latex; source code has been clicked. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding place will be jumped in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master-document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI, file is based on Ãµnders.â ¢} and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the fast-build process.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the processing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick installation of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for fast incorporation of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The verfÃ ¼ gable & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further is for items such as keywords, fuzz marks or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, a picture or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (choice for a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quote will display a selection list with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is required to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop down box named Countess e is used for setting up the font size e. there can be specified the font sizes for the main text, the R & D notes, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and stacking the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clasp according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] determines the font set. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu or the Knopf quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; allows storing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document complies, it should be searched for errors. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font raised e 12 is created and only a few countries should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the establishment of the font green within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only supervised within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for the italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be presented with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quotation begins with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; markup language has been presented, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & Kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be carried out. to do this, there should be a quote, a few places in fat and italics and a poem to apply to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI, file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and split it.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI, is a very dependent file format (E e V ice I nologies). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, file the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using a file (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI, file into other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into known other formats can begin by means of the toolbar in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search opens the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex binary files. to do this, only Modern under settings must be set up... Tools are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">The mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source code, and then clicked to default search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer then takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Eyepiece; set as a text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using the Quick Building of the & DVI, the error may occur. if an error occurs, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The source code snippets the source code in the source code. in the editor you can use the header's LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors for sprÃ ¼ nge between errors. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the relevant button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">If you select a blank document, a document can be rewritten from scratch, or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, please refer to the section below.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file Template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... Settings General are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and thus verbose the commands in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the template can then be selected instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. a simple way to create a template should be searched by one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; uses & kate; as an internal editor. & works; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and creating from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly from & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to learn about his possibilities, the book should be drawn up to Kate. users of & Kile; can work directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex command reference, which can be accessed via the LaTeX Reference menu. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, portions of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source textes and emphasize these. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include additional branding marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items are branded or the corresponding keys make the jump to the next or last jump.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile; although & kate, has been added in & Kile; important functions are added for writing a & latex; special commands for selecting a & latex; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Paragraphs a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with valid lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning will include tables, & latex; statements and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For clapping a part of the document natÃ ¼ rlich will be selected first and removed by pressing the key Del; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit selection paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore it offers & Kile; for additional commands under adapting environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to host the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, the superficial view can quickly be lost. this command buys the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environmental structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from working environments.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the soft staple of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups parentheses can quickly get lost. this command buys the most recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two easy reference marks are used as a valid sealer. for the purpose-bearing implementation, the character is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two easy reference marks.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic mount of double address signs can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to use specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French license plates. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, Enter & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), the command\\ item is not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">The current line with\\\\ terminates the current line with\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to assign the columns in tables environments, and thereby allude all Et-characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; try to achieve this. when pushing Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the current tab is not the same, add & Kile; some spacer for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added in & Kile; in order to include special commands (mostly for & latex;), three different modes are installed. all these modes can be set up for different working methods under settings Kile... fully customisable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} becomes & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of input is removed and the default list is substituted. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are natural when selecting a command. alternatively, it can be set by & Kile, so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible by editing branding marks and the desired parameters can then be set.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings Kile; set up... tile; complete settings can be made to these lists. it can be selected various types lists for & tex; - and latex; -orders as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher des Allgemeine Languages.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters entered with\\ begin and the call of default mode will have a large list of ambient commits. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the execution of environments is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the fully supported environment or the key Alt + Shift key Space key, the command to open the environment is automatically set and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & Kile, recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings Kile; set up... tile; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterliste des vervollstÃ ¤ndigt mode fÃ ¼ r & tex; - und & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supported custom lists of headers, which are immediately replaced by more lenient strings. the lists can be set up under settings Kile... Kile utilises the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the file L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word fullfill mode introduced through the menu or the key Ctrl + Alt Empertaste, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">GroÃ er e WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher sind fÃ ¼ r die automativervollstÃ ¤ndigung not helpful. however, it was noted that many more users in a document are written more than once.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... ile to be screened. here also the threshold for displaying the default can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The default files can be installed in subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / des PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home-folders. mode stands for abbreviation (Abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic representations create graphics as simple as possible. to supervise the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be noted and respected.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as familiar as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are grouped in the menus to create compiling, create converting and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for Viewer like & Eyepiece; or the additional conversion can be used to use the button1; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be converted to the default-like viewer by Alt; 3, converted to a PS file using Alt; 4, and by using Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Construction command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, there will be a new window each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project new project.... In this way, the following information is asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows executing ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= Kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different help to support the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are shipped with many documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further & latex reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not only a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete operating instructions for the & latex; and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; the finding of the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texlive; the small application of textilis containing a database of all documents to & Kile; provided documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-click with the mouse or the space of the Space button opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; workspace environment. & kde; is also part of the Fink project, whereby & Kile; also on & Mac; with installed OS-X can be executed.</seg>

<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action will connect to debugger if necessary, or it shares the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so it does not need to be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starte the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debit request has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to begin executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debit request has been made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, and if possible, it is properly cleaned in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the statement and go to the next as if there were the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the supervised value appears in the variable view.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declare whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in executing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that modify the document or use (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the quickstart dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. in this way attempt & quantaplus; the script to find: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>

<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, to the default output format, by setting the value the selection field output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the checkup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, in case the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" if available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an evil symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>

<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be interpreted as loose, strong, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will insert a & lt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there are still which ones, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some usual & quantaplus; add functionality to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar setting dialog on settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the separator (on the left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have quick access to the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could think that the & konqueror; knob is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup to the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar will be loaded (s) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec2.3.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.3.html tag = tag1.html tag3 = tag2html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box contents (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by confusing (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc from $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. there is an email sending menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download it. the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publication. to make an airport contribution, we recommend the source of resources, both for our team and later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resources dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the uploading will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar tool bar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in the event of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears indicating the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is possible to work by creating a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in the tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file using the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name to the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitional line: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user in person.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the Baumansichten, the boards with information and the toolbars. please refer to, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document ready entries, such as close the current, other or all cartridges, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area lead to another context menu with respect to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags, under the cursor or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the day. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as Anker), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumansichten (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open and browse in the information. in the presentation with file containers, for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation Baumansichten are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click. actions such as addition, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the entry system aligned to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web-technique for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two flads at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the checkup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the way to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar by email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed tar archive over & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus would be? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; well ahead on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why developing, which has already developed anyone else, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-layered actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can increase almost any task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of the documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or run khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently developed and managed by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, whereby the oldest item is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts a special character to & HTML by inserting the clipboard there, so that it is displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from clipboard in & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to paste & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch or off the block selector. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of script settings and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Activating and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecast or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only in this menu if you assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set by means of actions. toolbars are stored by toolbar toolbars or you are asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, wherever any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Upload a DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Active insertion activates or disables the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserts inserts by toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the menu items listed above. click on it. click on a activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available Hervorhebungsschemata depends on the unique; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or create unnice graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode corresponding to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; the main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML-Part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Addresses the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the cursor environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you handle local data. either a name (hostname.org) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. for server-based scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be haunted when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started anew, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to good thinners.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clasp out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu room in the sub-window profile or with the shortcut of key Shift; F7 will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard possible), that are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set using the Options button. in this case, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile Profile, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by applying a custom tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will occur. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening... in the context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will expire to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgot at program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk save option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it is not easy to read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply dowing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar in the project or project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; it is best to use the tool bar toolbar. adding and adding tool bars will be treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols can be set either using context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbar renaming or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, which actions on these or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action worked that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially a document skeleton, code snip and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the store tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in some of the limitations you present for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some of them with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to usage.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole sites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File as template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Now template save your choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and deposited onto the tree view template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag & drop, or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in project files, you can click on a folder on the right and choose Site Template, type a name for the template and backup. by default, it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can specify headlines and footers, or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert files or link them to them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window template is based on the files used in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parent attribute is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except for the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would basically deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, one probably is in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project, allowing copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (to show, press right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and adding templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the editor window into two parts: the editor window and the VPL-editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor on a document called & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in the source editor as well as in the VPL-editor and the cursor is running in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, puts the active cursor from a window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast computers and a big margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog will also be invoked as soon as a new document is created with the VPL-editor. this is used to reduce the hanging code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, for example, keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key word 2 on the Content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, due to paths with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by button or remove key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source editor. it is worth noting that inserting tags prior to previously existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, needs to be removed any other bounding tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style templates. in contrast to other styles of style templates, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; to successfully compile, use except & kde; even libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentment at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the feedback had changed. the merging of these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps dissolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when folders merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can make typing easier by typing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "diff3 Ordner1 Ordner2" "" "Ordner2" "" "Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o Zielfolder" ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening-Dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog shows your selection and shows it again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the default or merging folders will be initiated. however, if you select a file, for B and C, a folder is used, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not essential to immediately specify a output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the open dialog you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you'd need to create two corresponding files, then download them in & kdiff3; and then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info line is located. the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + e.g., white characters are relevant only in strings and comments, relevant for preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summarizing column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [change] if you edited the result. usually it contains by automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to move to the next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there will be no more row left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; then this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. carefully follow this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources are ignored when selecting the sources or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, side, beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl image downhill) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. therefore, distinction must be distinguished between dissolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if it is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is deleted. be careful with this option, because you might accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed sign\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenrückflow + Zeilenvorfach\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, therefore you should not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when used and restored at the next start. (setup Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays typefaces with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the button presets automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the return of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then drops.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car drop sign '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others then save only a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then they could be treated with different sizes in the page-on-side comparison, although they may be disabled. during merging this option must be disabled. in default, this is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic reshaping mode, this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Wähle A / B / C for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be replaced by the suffix .original. if already such a backup file with the suffix .stock exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to & kdiff3; exit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection box for the encoding appears to be a short note of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters can be treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you edit a file, you can specify which encoding should be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessors, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress protections of changes in white characters in the text or view columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignoriere C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded oversee column. but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or by one another. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide instantly to merge the files. a simple click starts merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first committed to that external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this feature e.g. for cutting disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to that external command (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. the output of the command is used only at line distance. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users greater flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefix command for line spacing to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression of the string matches each string. the\\ 1 in the substitution character refers to the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a preprocessor command is needed for line spacing that would change the automatically generated text. you can change the list as needed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built feature in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessor command for line abuses. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so almost erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different at perl. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may mistake certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... make a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder, you will be notified a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files will be listed, which were compared to that point.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder of the scan found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold a folder by double-clicking on + / - or double-clicking on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be folded and all subdirectories can be folded by which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the name column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors are red, green, yellow and black in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option directories are active synchronize. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical afterwards. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for output file only B; copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge (unreliable) then explores & kdiff3; the date of files and fails the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange may not be fixed, the merge of folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging one file will work after the other. you status column shows skill when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs. if the merge is completed, you should make a last check and see if the status is okay.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file-like method is selected in the Setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, solved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-folder-merge mode C is used as the target, the two-folder merge is selected B as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries might be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge command / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to select only the current item: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears to indicate the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Durchgehen, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge-window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select / continue folder merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, then a corresponding dialog will appear. then it leads & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you make the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3 allow you to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are combined individually, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at later. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many built-in files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that the folder specific can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot. a file is hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check on possible rections. a link to a folder containing a link on itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage does not cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the confidence of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results from merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. if an old backup file already exists with the .original extension, this will also affect the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of whole folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible during merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch off the option directory & text window and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu item in the directory menu. you can also create a single file directly, without having to start the folder together. once you save the result, the status will be set to Erleached and the file will not be merged once you start the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory again: list menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this for reading files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative. or.. contain. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blanks - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. a short list of constraints follows:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently seen as a difference viewer in ADBA. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files in the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; then start & kdiff3; the patch program will restart the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heat it) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 has already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't share the proper prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is actually the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "" "" "after the text is removed, it suddenly stops; No src won't be released, and the text cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can that be removed?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install, use the following command in the root folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and, therefore, not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must re-read the update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within a desktop and multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktop environments as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; however, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and exit. however, if applied to an application within & Kpager; however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimized, Maximize, On Desktop and Beverages. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names are indicated with ordinal numbers, and eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty work areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; appear in a 2xn-grid, as well as from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in horizontal row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager-Miniprogramme in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view the windows as symbols or with their content and move it. in addition, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen saver. you can use & kmag to enlarge part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for various users: these include artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag;</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is continually enhanced with new features. it is optimized for use on high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnification window. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & kmag; the range around the mouse pointer like a movable magnifier. alternatively, you can & kmag; to make a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop-drop mode) or the environment of the mouse cursor on the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer to hide. please note that the cursor is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; mousepointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down window you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you use the & Shift, press the button or use the & MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the drop-down window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Choose the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will be displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, open a new window, print, neulades (with the button document recharge in & konqueror;), Enlarge and shrink & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">It may also be known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen saver. you can use a magnifier, so as if you use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor harrt for a while at the same place. it is intended to help people suffering from the RSI Syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury syndrome) and pains any mouse-click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor harrt for a while at the same place. it is intended to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click pains pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by the mouse over the mouse, and as with all ergonomic tools: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you briefly interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent displacement activated, power & kmousetool; take a break after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can run the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the shift is switched on, the rotational shift time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it can release the mouse button again if there is no argument for the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that allows you to adjust to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it is started & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent slide should be switched off at first. if you have accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the intelligent slide.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of which places a mouse click doesn't work without any effect: clicking on the neutral elements of windows or at places in the browser window that does not link to unwanted reactions does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse ball out. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the soiling can be scratched easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use intelligent sliding in this case, that means & kmousetool; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you have a click of the mouse. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; to continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, you don't want to use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental Bewegen of the mouse can cause unintentional reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent sliding is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action you want to use the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent slide if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key down while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this makes every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click played. later you can use intelligent shifting even without the audible mouseclick. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button once the mouse cursor is briefly harrowing. this program was developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to ensure that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released. thus, dragging and laying with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2530">& kmouth; is a program that dumb users can let their computer speak for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2531">With the program & kmouth, dumb users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list of sets of conversation phrases that are to be talked again.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screenshot) enter the command which is later used for the speech output of text. for more details see the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text passbook. from the text passbooks you can often choose text passages without having to type them. text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot), you determine the dictionary for the word. & kmouth; read the KDE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of individual words. in addition, you can synchronize the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that words can only be recorded correctly in words.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">When you have correctly set up, you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear. each spoken proposition is attached to the running memory. you can select sets that are to be talked again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry settings kmouth; set up... open the Settings dialog by & kmouth; this dialog contains two flashcards, voice output and settings, the site Wortergänzung as well as the site KTTSD language service.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the card card voice output, enter the command to call the language generator. in the selection field below the input field, specify the character encoding, with the text passed to the language generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text is passed on as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders here:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the language output command depends on your language generator. you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator. examples of this can be found in the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2542">If that's successful, the other settings on this page will be ignored. if that's successful, the further settings on this page will be ignored. the ktsod language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SVN. choosing this option is useful even if KTTSD is not installed.</seg>
<seg id="2543">With the first selection field action after selecting a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by the keyword or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages text menu or in the toolbox for text strings.</seg>
<seg id="2544">The chosen text passage is inserted directly into the input field with the selection of In-In, the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">The second choice box Close the edit window for text passbook-book lets you determine if the text passbook-book should be saved automatically when closing the processing window.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Save the book. if you choose to discard changes, the text passcode book will not be saved. select Before Save, it becomes & kmouth; ask if the text passbook is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2547">The word dictionary contains a list of dictionary textbooks. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a selection field, if this list contains more than one dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the desired language for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can put together the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">This option allows you to create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. da & kmouth; newly typed words automatically add to the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passbook books is divided. in the upper part, the text strings are represented as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard shortcut. if you have selected a text passbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Adding actions like new text passages or books or deleting selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar, toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The order of text passbooks or text passages can be changed by dragging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the & Alt; key.</seg>
<seg id="2556">The selected text is cut out and copied to the clipboard. if a text section is selected in the input field, it is used, otherwise the selected fields of the default memory.</seg>

<seg id="2559">If this menu entry is checked, a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed. by default, the toolbar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing pane. by clicking on the hatch left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2560">If this menu entry is checked, a narrow strip at the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of & kmouth; displayed if not checked, this status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2561">If this menu entry is checked, a sliding bar is displayed for text strings with entries. the toolbar is arranged by default via the editing pane directly under the toolbar. by clicking on the hatch left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location.</seg>

<seg id="2567">For the third example, the option must be switched on as standard input. (this is the recommended example of the application of FreeTTS.)</seg>
<seg id="2568">MBROLA is a language generator for many languages. it converts a list of phonemes into a wavedatei, so you need an additional program to disassemble the text in phonemes. the license allows MBROLA to use MBROLA free of charge for non-commercial and non-military applications.</seg>
<seg id="2569">In our example, Hadifax is used to convert the German text into phonemes for MBROLA, assuming that Hadifax and MBROLA are installed in / usr / local / hadifax and / usr / local / MBROLA.</seg>
<seg id="2570">Unfortunately, Hadifax likes to swallow up the last character of the text, so that an additional character has to be added. the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples:</seg>
<seg id="2571">(cat -; echo '; & quot;) _ BAR _ / usr / local / jifax / txt2pho -f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MBROLA / MBROLA / de1 / de1 / tmp / tmp.wav; rm / tmp / tmp.wav</seg>
<seg id="2572">All parts of the command must be written in one line. the option to send data as default input must be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2573">The voice output demon of & kde; (KTTSD) is a standard interface for voice output. KTTSD is currently being developed in the SVN. it uses modules to support various voice output systems.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Since the setting of the language generator takes place only in the KTTSD, you only have to use it as a language service in & kmouth; setting.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To setup use the page KTTSD language service, which appears in the Settings dialog from & kmouth; appears if KTTSD is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2576">To use it successfully, you need a language generator (and of course & kde; 3.x). & kmouth; requires about 15 MB memory (and additional memory for the language generator), but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech-dispatcher program. it is useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech dispatcher" "" "works with a text." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of screen readers is read, the held orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you can read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text assignments. every job you encounter from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text assignments. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String inserts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with predefined strings of strings, which allow replacing of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the re-formatting of messages from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of scope of delivery, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With chord selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts, sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is used for voice output. if the filter finds that its rules are not true, the text remains unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the usual standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will display the following set-up dialogs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text. upper and lower case is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erbet. the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list of a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages when you click the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be used when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID run programs are available with the qdbus; the & DBus; numbers you need to omit. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Kopete-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string insertion filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string insertion filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separators (blanks) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find a manual to write regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialog or edit it as help for assembling these expressions. the & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions you can find in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be used on shapely XML. it can be installed on your system only.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker optional filter you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card card narrator, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is sent to the filter, it is looking for a spokesman for the text. the speaker is selected by means of the speaker features that the program gives, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the subscriber you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to display the dialog selection.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The voice synthesizers used by & ktts have their own license, which you will find in the related documentation or on the related web pages. there are also voices which have their own license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the kdedir package with & ktts; from it. & ktts; find the source code of kdedir under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any language synthesizer, which can be launched on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, drag the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the ktts website; for information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand the use of a different synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages of kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from the source code for kdeDemo or download the tarball generated each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; first check if speech dispatcher works properly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; it uses the program speech dispatcher. the kttmsgr utility should be developed in such a way that the installation of speech disks is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into single phrases. the user can leave punctuation or reject, repeat, stop or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it may specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. thus, an application can request a female English speaker. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender, it is automatically selected. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a spokesperson chooses, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card board speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card card spokesperson setup will be displayed. as an example, the installation of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details of the modules you will find under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you only need to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the string encoding for text that is passed to festival. in case of voices, the & ktts; this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slide controls provide volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few knobs and this grey is displayed, the voice you selected does not allow you to select these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a spokesperson (or forgot to click on users).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window tsmgr is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the symbol kttsmBar is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the symbol in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTL reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence. the spokesperson ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several movements).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK all changes of the settings (also on the other cards) are taken over and kttsmgr shrinks to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen readers has been read, the held orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these assignments will be continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have just read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, add & edit the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card pass only apply to normal text assignments. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the issues of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read Knotfy messages, start kttsmgr and click alerts. the card card notifications appears.</seg>

<seg id="2718">You can enter the properties of the desired speaker. standard selects the speaker, which is shown in the list on the card holder as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, this action is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option, the action arrives for carrying out under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the application default (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can specify the notifications as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, voice speed, volume, voice and pitch. SSML is a part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound in the Festival Configuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and statute capture filter (SDB filter). SBDs can start writing text into single phrases. this allows you to start reading faster with pre-reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set of rules mark filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set of rules recognitions filters are set up automatically. you can change its settings or add another set of rules, beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the simplest learn how to set up the language selection by trying out. switch off the selection of the speaker and select text to read. switch off the selection of the speaker, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. in addition, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">I'm not sure where you're getting your info, but great topic. I needs to spend some time learning much more or understanding more. thanks for sharing! |</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text files on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set of rules will automatically be set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits filters compare text with a regular expression for typing and insert a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set of rules will retain the set setting.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (renotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>

<seg id="2749">I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if that's successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you found the voice, the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable about the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive now offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; prereads. (this is because HTML is converted into SSML. SSML has its own tags, with which the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; after-SSML reformed filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>

<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4, the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktts; first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full language output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. Festival generates this by & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German texts Diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure additional wrapper code is added to festival to use & MBROLA; voices to use voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in & MBROLA; folder, but in the festival / lib /. instructions can be found at</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows managing network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed on the installation of & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. when starting the network settings, this program tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be identified, the choice is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and balance. by selecting the non-recurring question, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means that the settings can only be considered, the change is not possible. in the system administrator mode, you can enter the system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administrator mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... setup in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information for each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface on boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. activating a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching off a activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS gets this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The host name resolution part of the viewer's name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it displays the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button. the entry is then inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select an entry from the group calculator and then click Edit... It will display the Edit Edit button.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named known calculator describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP sub-system. it is primarily used for boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list includes some known hosts some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit machines is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console, with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and Qt suffices; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, and knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on basic network technology, in the second section, all of them are discussed by & knetworkconf; modifiable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found much dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing what IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person to assign a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that operates like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified dynamically with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is referenced by the Scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpack. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife posed: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrain the tape and read the band's pre-tensioning information. don't recognize the band, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the default, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you'll be asked if the band index is to be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for tape drive changes, to show that the tape was embedded. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the band from & kdat. floppy tape drives usually require a formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity drives & kdat; continue with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the tape will be lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files given in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reproduce the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been restarted, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the belt file with the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workfolder where backup should take place. the list of files to be insured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only those files in it will be backed up in the same file system as the folder. folders that lie on other file systems can be logged separately under backup files. each entry is considered from tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the button files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-recurring version of the tape machine.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmits & kdat; before the tape embeds the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; to lock the ejector at tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, it is automatically ejected by the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option at Floppy Streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to notify & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a volume is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is hostname: seconds, with the name of the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; tar can manage. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog, experienced users provide quick access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server. and ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and analysed.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, the system log is trying to open the system log. it will not appear to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely do not have system administrator privileges. the protocol files usually don't have a permission to read them in the folder / var / log, for the normal user.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter row to filter for a selected criterion or after entered strings. the list of log lines will now be changed automatically so that only minutes of log lines are displayed, which are displayed for the selected filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter keyword is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, select the process name in the log file system log, and also enter the name of a process in the filtering strip, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as minutes lines of the stage indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in a setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use FilterPanel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the option to skip to new lines in the main window context menu in order to display all the new, upcoming log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org Dort you can find more information about the sources from & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; in the following directory of the & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start-up when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might attempt to change a machine to System V Init without requiring a reinstallation and re-formatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an Init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have completed something, then you will repair it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop httpd servers. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or modify the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen when you draw an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new area. to only copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly choose to copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it to the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Verfügbare Systemdienste, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with slipping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by using the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine is restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt in linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions makes it easier to configure the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv plan to extend the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as Apache or httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adapting of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you will need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or record in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled expansions (quota) for users, a card card will be created by which you can make individual settings. other card cards appear, if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one built-in file system space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the space constraints are given in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group's members belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootstrap, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
