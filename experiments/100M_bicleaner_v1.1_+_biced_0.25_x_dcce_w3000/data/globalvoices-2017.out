although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sports .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist , mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , un@@ covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspi@@ racy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ates , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interests .
I was imprison@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admi@@ ration for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in comments .
the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential election was the highest number that had ever reached a nomin@@ ee nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist &apos;s program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ umps world view did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
m@@ umps Int@@ oler@@ ance also contra@@ sts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confront@@ ation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as raci@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congreg@@ ations are not taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; p@@ un from white in all@@ usion to wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a huge part of the White Americas has this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd bro@@ wned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried out and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music by gar@@ bage
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ ag@@ ua@@ an town Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
the fact that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse and violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ limmer of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ cket you learn the day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , wood horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7@@ .000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ visited instruments , made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recy@@ cl@@ er began to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made of the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the initial period :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as a f@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of gar@@ bage every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspi@@ rational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is carried out as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in Liberia , before it looked for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpet@@ r@@ ator of this species on its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to tap one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishermen &apos;s authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded in FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( illegal fishing ) .
apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that at the time had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other , where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to detect . this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ respect of existing laws , through which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ icious driving routes can be discovered - such as those pointing out that a ship sends its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a catch license , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financi@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishing coming into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishing .
their practices , including sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , specification of fancy names , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not start my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ m to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close the FISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has discovered criminal networks that shared counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at try@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be loc@@ alized by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help FISH @-@ i to find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
but FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and Oce@@ ana , a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project , in which a global system allows prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als but also deter them .
ships which previously had to fish without licence and had little to face consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
when FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ netz@@ e , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be produced in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used by drag@@ ging nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning &quot; the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emp@@ tin@@ ess by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but eventually the rel@@ u@@ ctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Marianne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decree as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching short@@ age of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new governance .
the voting alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called upon the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on 27 October , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on November 3 .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :

the images of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testi@@ fy among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures accum@@ ulating about confront@@ ations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement by the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts because you could see anything else what many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the degree of oppression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of the sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !

others regard these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , has under@@ gone a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches increasingly take on frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 was subjected to crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ie &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called for me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP friends .
pass just that they don &apos;t kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . my father had educated me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were dropped and chat@@ ted with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ake in , and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and h@@ unted him a cargo of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ it@@ als .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied to their hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people cau@@ ti@@ ously sit on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survivors of the Civil War Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was sentenced to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges , which one takes off an enemy that one fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war @-@ prey but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who cho@@ oses cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do this !
that was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I said , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testi@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last hein@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why children are kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why should their bodies be removed ?
did these people not also have families with whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last hein@@ ous act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was restored , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and disp@@ osed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - among them my father .
the thought to display my father was created during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ g@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have anybody killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they claimed were supposed to be good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only re@@ prov@@ oked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pret@@ end that I am pre@@ occupied . I ended up against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnit@@ ude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended on the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended li@@ fel@@ ong sentences and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were free claims .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by am@@ t@@ sp@@ ers@@ ons . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism
all the def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silence chambers :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the attor@@ ney of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was to be built , so that there could be a memorial site that is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Ky@@ oto become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ ary drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a center in Ky@@ oto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month , witnesses of a very mis@@ erable translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retired motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was wron@@ g@@ ly translated - perhaps but also with bad hin@@ d@@ sight &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 @-@ 20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n magazine published in Ky@@ oto writes :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city such as Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H2@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents is quite a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period .
the name not mentioned by name expressed in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to take against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So fl@@ a@@ wed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the original text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the belief that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate the English into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language to translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies which do not have any foreign employees , nevertheless make translations in company @-@ internal . then the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the s@@ worn and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences origin@@ ating from mechanical translations show that this technique can still not replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling print@@ outs that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less than jewellery . but by big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city Ky@@ oto hopefully uses a more serious source of translation in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nav@@ eg@@ ri con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
also other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried photos of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups that the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros resist@@ ed .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and deleg@@ ated the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have been locked again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to telec@@ oms them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at it as a &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , that it is still more favorable than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had found that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains faul@@ ty .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds error or ref@@ uses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ acas live .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police cust@@ ody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ cket as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testimon@@ ies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a Report by Kur@@ tural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned here , however , is that the children must carry out home@@ work for it that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice - collected testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ ticism , is generally still silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they can shut down their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that takes care of the girl and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will be experienced only a few years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the hi@@ ther@@ to relatively unknown phenomenon occ@@ uring in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of heavy blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira proposed to Mar@@ Ã­n as long as they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest against protest and demanded that &quot; no other Carolina &quot; should be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be directional - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ tas aren &apos;t only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
her brothers now had to work all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished her learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held it intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone listening while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ ani , would again speak their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they allowed her to lose again , she explains .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and the ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships emerge , I feel particularly clear that I belong to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job adverti@@ sements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ ots in Paraguay .

Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the display once again :
dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?

the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the public domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently voted on a draft bill on &quot; Reg@@ ulations in terms of use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by the Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt by a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up that is t@@ asked to use citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission to use social media &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law users would have to register with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a bu@@ cket .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application running and used on the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up registration . it is not clear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to secure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar MEP , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to inv@@ ade a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to access information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Chief Scienti@@ st &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they pret@@ end that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislative of parliament and constitutional committees , before entering into the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , parliament@@ arians Tam@@ er El Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;

a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards fighting through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conserv@@ ation of Nature .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see an Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .

early March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ ached a nuclear accident , already alone , 16@@ 0,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
from a local point of view , the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been reached six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the report provides detailed information on the number of deals and their value categ@@ orized into deal types , sub @-@ sector and regions .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement buildings were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ens@@ wÃ ften , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ens@@ wÃ ften , Kazakhstan , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , can be found in final replacement homes .
after the triple disaster almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there were still more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , who had breath@@ ed after the disaster in homes , were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have been res@@ umed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land , have excell@@ ed passi@@ vely .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 ha of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear barrier zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that almost half of the coastal inhabitants have since the catastrophe more difficult to earn their li@@ veli@@ hoods .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to find an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her reception changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced .
more than 16@@ 0,000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 6@@ 0,000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,@@ 000 people res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
after the 2017 stand , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which still lives in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they fail to return to proper accommodation , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recogni@@ zes that one more links than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came her aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia was struck with a head@@ stock against the head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a trau@@ ma trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly within a few days in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the fac@@ ebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and split up several hospitals shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a stroke .
police acc@@ esses to police
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only country in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police he@@ els against prot@@ esters last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber sho@@ cks and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announ@@ cements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed street protests by direc@@ ting the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pan@@ eling .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliber@@ ated specifically about a broken glass window in order to depic@@ t their title pages in an illu@@ stra@@ tive manner with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set of fire placed on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pan@@ elling than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognized when you are strictly against any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are conce@@ aled by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confront@@ ation with the police . &quot;
the For@@ gotten To@@ wns in Cuba from the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alisation
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers closed doors all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ with@@ standing that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some rarely changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ rated and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane manufacturers exist , which are in operation after a long period of in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls precisely to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly viable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production targets were 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar rise in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agriculture perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely come into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane manufacturers , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closing of the factory , is the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to preserve the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
these were officially contained documents , which were distinguished only in regard to the parts which would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any escape .
from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; he insur@@ es .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory where he helped build it .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus becomes apparent that the young participants in discussions like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum alkal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen most indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ ak@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will receive our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we have lost our way of life as a youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the crop in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant .
the customers see themselves as these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin gent@@ pur@@ u .
now on sale : new with plastic rub@@ b@@ ish decorated cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu shop .
many of these artificial food items have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin radi@@ ator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complicated .
in this case an ka@@ ise @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , IC@@ UR@@ A or Sal@@ mon rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melt ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic items can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # 2
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drugs traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of in- and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ects and perpet@@ rators are regularly appearing in statistics . these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings .
the reports on drug traffi@@ cking like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed or the congreg@@ ations who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learn with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were caught in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime not only lets us fear our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass through newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbelievable for me , if the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to imagine that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four month black@@ mail in Haupt@@ stadt@@ distri@@ kt &quot; : how a family has been lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als press money from their business month by month , until they had destroyed not only the business , but also had torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain on it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report in the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The Un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , so@@ ak potatoes , warm tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been past two years earlier , when he had only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings , according to the Government of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ als 8.5 mor@@ als per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages linked to which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is that after something the first time has appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether true or unt@@ rue , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false Cont@@ ext &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the town of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of impact holes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank tro@@ l@@ ley dropped to the victim .
government representative described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the football world champion@@ ships .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; vom Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch it .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been ti@@ pped several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities , in which they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and b@@ ushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es from the DR Congo , when it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ prints ; Africa check has documented orders relating to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of San@@ ge appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations , those who flee could flee blo@@ ws , rape and many dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , which fal@@ sely claimed 2012 , the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians involved themselves in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original article , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to being this statement , but had not linked the picture from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are similar to the said image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some others tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have unlimited examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries on which side they were published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have been associated with each other in some cases ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :

the orange countries point out to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods .

as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital published by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , has expressly declared that the picture does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar d@@ ash@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the image later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria runs , die Welt asleep ) .
the image of the DR Congo came up with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Mass@@ ac@@ re of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was taken as evidence for the Mass@@ ac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ pt ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be fal@@ si@@ fied .
from the emb@@ assy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of an er@@ ron@@ eous use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the grey folder ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and sometimes they have image files related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater debates about the silence associated with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are unt@@ rue and the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent images has already been extensively discussed ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the res@@ ig@@ nation of images of a ref@@ usal comes to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot about discussing violent accounts in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or in a completely mis@@ understood way .
however , any investigation of wrong write @-@ ups should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or even impossible to translate .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Look around your parents in recognition of how they tried to keep you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that one feels after having grown in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they s@@ ander other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ encia O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the Sri Lanka Kat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ent@@ re from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud tor@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and some 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe resi@@ dences .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water st@@ alls in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ appro@@ achable areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et regularly supply updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ rise , Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
different organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood events and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue team need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the region around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data using the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ enter will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then distributed free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also launched a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust in her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied up from an American flag , others sk@@ en@@ ch slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they have mus@@ li@@ zed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into , have to be de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed .
Ent@@ mus@@ li@@ mis@@ cht werden kann ( in german )
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
to be in love ?
to die ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western conception , the religion was er@@ ased Rum@@ i , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colonial books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing imag@@ ery is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic woman who should be saved .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s placed the story behind these pictures .
but these images still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al it .
I have been working for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabia to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ ra@@ tiv weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought back with slavery ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively occupies our collective imagination so deeply and fl@@ a@@ wed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Semi@@ tic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion are
in the news industry we are doing more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ ra@@ tives of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation who come from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first Schmuck@@ design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American fan@@ atic of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had re@@ thought about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were rel@@ ent@@ less Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a mad Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or wearing my hand@@ ful hand@@ book that all Muslims carry - &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ aste . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic series with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information which our already fl@@ a@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who bit@@ es a woman &apos;s head cloth .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below .
screenshot of the AC@@ LU page .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it att@@ aches our identity that is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and multi@@ fac@@ eted that it cannot fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they use the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the most evening ritual with my daughter when I wie@@ v her in my arms and whis@@ pers her the Arabian Ver@@ ses to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim religion is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as they were winning a competition for the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings painted by Su@@ fi Hei@@ liger ; and one Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Me , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that - over centuries - was colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire &quot; that a company founded with the name Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ in@@ dies company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in between , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ eping around his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by colon@@ ists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; to four Muslim countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history has been rejected over a Muslim country one century ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , cl@@ assy subject of the British Empire , was called &quot; danger@@ ously &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes back deep into our unforgettable family @-@ trees ; our un@@ f@@ etter@@ ed history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over each continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy reads the US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination .
it means to know that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a fre@@ ed black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to that country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate them to others .
the nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion bul@@ bs more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing second &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim region@@ als that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just countries that are bombar@@ ding it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically correct picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply advised to ab@@ stain the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous print@@ outs that we ste@@ al in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ O@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ CE , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
scre@@ enshots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
Coll@@ age the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time we are in .
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story of which I was not aware of when I was so old now , as my daughter is now , but who today made me a mad Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity may listen to a story , where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ vers@@ ations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mics deal with our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enth@@ ron@@ ed by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we did not have President , bombar@@ ded the chocolate cake as he already bom@@ bed cap@@ ut@@ te lands and &quot; to other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ ra@@ tives wants to preserve urban variety
story telling , by Fli@@ ckr user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible response .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ett@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to soci@@ alize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format story @-@ t@@ ellers first present their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and representation will lead to the fact that the audience can be en@@ forced .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video , for example , shows a traditional tale of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and ci@@ vic organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march was launched at the Capit@@ ol , the capital &apos;s government building , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ uro @-@ audit of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
Puerto Rico &apos;s people claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to deal with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing government supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extern@@ ally imposed measures will be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration brought the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open web .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference for digital culture , hosted in Berlin , an event was dedicated to the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , managing director of book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is available free of charge here contains a series of ess@@ ays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the moti@@ ons for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , imprison@@ ed in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introdu@@ ctory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ consuming extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , its place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of the creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels had cultural prot@@ otypes more predict@@ able than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would do everything to wi@@ pe out this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
so far Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other incar@@ n@@ ates to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ verb that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envel@@ ope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace ,
that it doesn &apos;t matter to me any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men
I forget the prison of prison
and I sing in every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
if your eyes say good@@ bye
and I &apos;m leaving another piece of my soul with you ...
I swi@@ ft@@ ly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
a year goes , my soul
during the week
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
the history of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
since the start of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption , director after release of corruption again at previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted angr@@ ily to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace after half of his prison sentence in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants because of imp@@ air@@ ment of 54 million years ( around 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post as the company did not perform a disciplinary procedure after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle strongly condemned the company &apos;s decision to res@@ ign the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustr@@ ates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we have to note is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company , however , seems to have no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had left half .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and pol@@ lu@@ te his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is will@@ ingly paid for his silence .
irre@@ voc@@ ably !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza mis@@ ses mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only himself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state when it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself was we@@ ary of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief belonged to the prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to remain in memory for the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he energe@@ tically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions also declined :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .
and today the company , in which he makes money , res@@ umes again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Ð·@@ Ð½Ð°@@ Ñ Ðº ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &apos; Indian . &apos;
Facebook is cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or accelerated jar@@ gon soup as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely decre@@ asing con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts describing the use of the word have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ts is the opinion that it will dimin@@ ish hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical , before it del@@ etes all post@@ ings that arise in sus@@ pic@@ ion of r@@ rac@@ ism .
Facebook sol@@ ves the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ ook .
what to do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , the hate speech spread , receive quite good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I came to this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was told the Li@@ ken , posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail doesn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinions on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asked for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genetic cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big deal of sales , it would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook remo@@ ves the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , in social networks , hate speech is meant to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ation of hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked more current , more in context than in code focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concluded with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the mar@@ ital age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage network , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ th@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , had gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not interv@@ ene , since the age of age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements striving to abol@@ ish children &apos;s marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts were whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and pro@@ claim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a Status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one voted against it .
once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of children were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ acious news !
the network has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marri@@ age@@ able age of Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change of the married couple was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted .
it was a long struggle ( ... )
thank you to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
thanks to our MEPs .
yet a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hin@@ du organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to oppose the law , most social media users would wish to address the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply talk that the state , our daughters would protect that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ beaten men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .

since more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based ency@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ or@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many technology @-@ related Internet users are used to use wra@@ pper tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content is available , despite legal prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we do everything to copy snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed fashion .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely scre@@ enshots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought about tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar errors if logged in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ igra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan @-@ Dig@@ igra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ ak &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ hl@@ ing r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission to use .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and was@@ hable colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animal world onto the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how he was able to help him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to gn@@ at pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to collaborate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ tune &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood by face to face to face to face :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz appeared . he immediately sets out , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he took a photo of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arri@@ vals .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convi@@ cted by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with name .
the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less evidence to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , became a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al Camp@@ aig@@ n , which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is committed to the degra@@ dation of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices such as child marriage to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and dire@@ cts these clubs .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they maintain all du@@ ti@@ ties and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try at home at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she only cons@@ ented to her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in Adr@@ en@@ aline rush about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , which indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the car@@ cin@@ oid @-@ red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped carrying it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never really talked about some things such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have worn only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s ok , but some wanted a sal@@ war spa , a wide shirt over a pants , wear ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ ality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped talking about the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ull for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag couldn &apos;t find the beat@@ les commemor@@ ative session in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here made it clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Day in Japan . when they were 51 years ago they were in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese Central schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
right now in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and walked over the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan community also commerci@@ ally , such as this cycl@@ amen store ( seeds are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! pussy Today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day will proceed .
so , we hope you are there !

man @-@ headed men are displac@@ ed and killed in Moz@@ ambique

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of people for organ traffi@@ cking , pres@@ um@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the area of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken out .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can contain gold or bring wealth , the spokes@@ person of the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of decre@@ es for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with alco@@ hol@@ ism .
this led the UN 2016 to conduct a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be W@@ ey@@ a lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already followed the case :
PR@@ M thinks that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of men &apos;s men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious ritu@@ als , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also ackno@@ wle@@ dges that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power the riches of riches .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ antha reported on Facebook the chron@@ icles of the blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Moz@@ ambique is facing :
I would like to call A MO@@ SA@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH , a country in which people would have shame to go onto the street , dressed as che@@ wing sex against good grades , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; black magic &quot; would be h@@ unted , which aim to achieve instant wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ person Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ are @-@ headed :
Moz@@ ambique authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald @-@ headed people .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese president , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , free of charge or permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ umed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon voyage to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price .

Li@@ u An@@ walt told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells the story :

the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 , around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Association of Law@@ yers , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city .
... No one ques@@ tioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , you can say that we are not a country in the end .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of it , it was inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in the end , in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam there were answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system .
he tar@@ ried the corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our valued K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
please read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoyed free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of those cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said .
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correct and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review disman@@ tled the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credi@@ ble a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ udi@@ an spokes@@ person ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur return ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s both land and city .
as he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours covered over certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans are different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they are travelling .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
with us there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; obviously we say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d like to switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to be spe@@ edy - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ killer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really were a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things happening around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open hear@@ ty , which I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada pretty sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ ody , which seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girl@@ friend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not specifically political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video up@@ loaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , especially as it beha@@ ves in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the Dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the pro@@ visional Constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity was established in the army , super@@ vised by the online content and persons accused of viol@@ ating the monarchy , was prosec@@ uted .
Thailand relies heavily on &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tribute von Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ etic war has been formally termin@@ ated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and la@@ wns live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the county was 16@@ .000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , which are called Khr@@ ush@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are covered and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ ush@@ che@@ ho@@ kas , which are still one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , it is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
some ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ YA tells them that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; aunt G@@ AL@@ YA calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative district in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha obt@@ ains about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ck@@ ens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy h@@ un@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball that is then rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ still@@ ness in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Win@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people to come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept on boxes outside .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ghurt market ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
it explains that their Christian belief is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is well known here , but she is not the only spar@@ ks hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have been living in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to sque@@ eze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult quietly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she pu@@ ffs with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she briefly presented it to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users neglected ä¸­@@ å½@@ Robot@@ s.net fortune
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification where they instru@@ ct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing it from getting access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities also used the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Aut@@ onom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police informed that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ wang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Jiang@@ su Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict regions , the authorities often order extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the media outlet , based on Twitter based media outlet , &quot; images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official j@@ ing@@ wang @-@ app .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the world .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; also published a Jing@@ wang product description , which emerg@@ es from the fact that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of Jing@@ wang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in Jing@@ wang may be a reaction to the direc@@ tives of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and the parties affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report from Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and discover that you are alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one who makes all honor to her name .
one who has de@@ pressed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality cat@@ ches you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth is on the axis of evil . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , like weed out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to make the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbour@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things were cal@@ med down after the electricity stopped functioning in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , crying out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice conf@@ lic@@ ting through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous picture that filled my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care for you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice back after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security .
I arrived there .
the Colonel G@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colonel G@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into your eyes and not on the floor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father just with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the farm and into the second office which leads through a passage to the individual cells .
I conc@@ eive of all details exactly before I looked after the room .
otherwise they have probably shared a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and can set me immediately without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureaucra@@ t left the cell and I res@@ orted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : to strike with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ gen@@ osse was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no noticeable facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are den@@ ial of its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
kitchen in the Ey@@ ser@@ beck @-@ House , Lu@@ isi@@ um
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these cro@@ ws , which refres@@ h themselves in the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams will be so@@ wn every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light , which presented to us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to 13 . S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal ext@@ in@@ ction card and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house here , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I super@@ vised the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that gli@@ de away : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am used to not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the se@@ wers .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give it the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with it and you cannot hold your sh@@ outs .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him enough , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the , from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and did not find any fav@@ ors at all , which is why he served as the next to an electri@@ cally charged stick .
electricity flo@@ wed my whole body , enough to feed my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body which stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours later , that happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ass@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he cal@@ ms to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine spot@@ ted lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ it@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist oppos@@ ing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world .
at the age of 25 H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can feel at home with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special tendency against American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; is what he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphas@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a human being poured into two cups dissolved in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot jun@@ k has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gn@@ om@@ es of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the che@@ ering of the c@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a open @-@ air prison , especially when one thro@@ ws a glimpse into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an &apos;s water - to not land in jail .
recently the Ministry of Interior Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contradi@@ cts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the conc@@ ession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to be campaig@@ ning for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simple rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ all@@ ising reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender norms to portra@@ y his vision of the fate of Arab women who mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently destroyed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ or@@ able Mor@@ ses &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is compo@@ unded by the lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in adequate ways .
according to a law on crime of crime dating from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ fam@@ atory violence can &quot; be imprison@@ ed in prison for in@@ definite time , &quot; and for their release , there is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to shy away from themes that are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he states that he can &apos;t separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of opinion , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kl@@ es the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which , in his words , &quot; what you want , &quot; be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + -@@ individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn down , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was up@@ loaded without inc@@ isions but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not escape Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ff , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poem .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ff , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a &apos; or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance , with the grounds that they had cri@@ tically expressed comments in social media about the problems that were deeply rooted in the land .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now led M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and inner changes . he is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is approached by means of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , sc@@ atter@@ ing uni@@ tions and democra@@ cies led to artificial nature . at least , he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to carry on and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ lords are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory says that the tro@@ l@@ leys , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years , mar@@ ched in the Nor@@ theast of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emission @-@ hi .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a communal center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fe@@ ats are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high soli@@ dly car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian young people away from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smoking and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
at the same time Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and hence the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal people go into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy School , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in the hair@@ dressing room instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered by dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built up this educational community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colombia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love &apos;s Let@@ ters to Guer@@ ill@@ ac@@ Ã¤mp@@ fer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign called Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part : after years of negoti@@ ation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bian , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out their arms around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , again ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , has to take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary .
he tar@@ ried , told him to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent attention .
so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the FAR@@ C , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the FAR@@ C stood up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they didn &apos;t receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can run through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we handed over the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a le@@ thal weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered him anyway and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ches .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger death . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new votes for new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the FAR@@ C already acted in secret .
therefore the FAR@@ C leaders explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injus@@ tice on the part of the State affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing a political party , we can help shape society in this country more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnit@@ ude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people , whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate , were only people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to interv@@ ene and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the FAR@@ C now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ by@@ owa and whose initial publication took place on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hor@@ r@@ ors , activists have witnessed reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat posed by the D@@ amo@@ cles beyond the LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won several months ago by the international head@@ lines after reports published which themati@@ zed the dep@@ ortation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ w@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she sen@@ sed that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had experienced from the sex em@@ ble@@ ation of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
fear@@ ing her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , which can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the turn of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you scar@@ let ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started crying .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you laid - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of an alphab@@ et .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running out the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 m was standing under the window .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
I don &apos;t want to give up their names for security reasons , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you &apos;ve left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you plug in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an items I still wear in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid inj@@ uring her .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself trouble to look like the person that she reminds of her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those that have stood still ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for me , I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told me that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably charge relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are there gay men now still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to make Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped in order to radi@@ c@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprison@@ ed for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new of them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it so far . we susp@@ ect however that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have themselves ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ ductions of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the seri@@ ousness !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short loops .
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria has never j@@ ammed my hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never h@@ unted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period stop ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he spoke not about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
whoever laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating .
OC Media : which activity are you going on now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I esc@@ orted them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t waste a cent for that .
I have discovered these people by myself when I ap@@ point refuge .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is true .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion purely .
this is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to proph@@ esy to you with foam before the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ro@@ dents have which , the cab@@ in@@ ers have which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet there is - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant to me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think in transition identi@@ ties to males who love males , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different ways - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because of that - I just know I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ ral community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ vi@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ mad human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ eg@@ hani &apos;s hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more .
he died a short while later .
it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ mad Centre for Human Rights reported that a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - have been hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to live their families due to the persecution from the Iranian government , and felt unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ z@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their li@@ veli@@ hoods .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and 1925 had great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ vi@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuse the Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s that run water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ tor@@ ate of Co@@ oper@@ atives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ mad &apos;s who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at cr@@ ushing the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , a human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad Men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic performers and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab ancest@@ or will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aiming at cr@@ ushing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their li@@ veli@@ hoods beyond their homeland .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ mad and so disgu@@ ised , since even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab ancest@@ ry must end@@ ure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , that despite the same education women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in diverse areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to terms of skin colour , on rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of ra@@ cial violence that we are exposed to black women in a two @-@ way way .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and towns earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background more often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want that all men , all men and all men do not have the same rights of any skin colour whatsoever ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in which centre is the white woman who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ ti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to both the gender and the colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to differenti@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of w@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recru@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks that we can defend ourselves by defining spaces in which they are completely safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atis@@ m and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med , fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq .

Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of Article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected person .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the ac@@ claimed adver@@ t of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was useful .
a few days later , the second woman pulled back her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women at all permit an advertisement , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must register at all by law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ ts@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation impacts and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the numbers available are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office received 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the adverti@@ sements in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the adverti@@ sements , 40 % of women said that they were ab@@ used physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who ref@@ und@@ eth ad due to physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists count at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence through men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she still gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she gave birth to psych@@ ic violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult identi@@ fiable :
I never thought I would be victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too serv@@ ile because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report the ill @-@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos herself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria Santos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill @-@ treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , it received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ comprehen@@ sible j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish tough@@ er as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the law of law has been changed in some respects , in order to also win the MEPs for the law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be denied , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and being punished with up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft constitution had provided the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if it simply ref@@ uses to provide an indication and to obtain a safe place of residence to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here an outline must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are free to depart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the Law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was passed . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice once more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media reported attacks in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decree of the Ministry of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he serves a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had depos@@ ed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the secret intelligence , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of press , and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on July 26 , 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties tied the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was charged from the ISS before the Special Department and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS held the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister had given the instructions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 banned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ at took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material , which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i there was a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court said to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after losing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is sentenced to imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also raised the decree of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Court &apos;s decision to rel@@ oc@@ ate Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Government of the Republic .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed an additional order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister was once again opposed to the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to re@@ equi@@ p the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was injured in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include the closure of the website of independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and exer@@ ting pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive breach of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including legal c@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather peace , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with its agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : for a lack in the supply of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic demonstrated first grave effects on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian public health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently studying a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being laugh@@ ing ourselves .
the solutions we get are often un@@ usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GF : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GF : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GF : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how Open Source &apos; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ eful and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them anymore .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or m@@ illed leaves .
over the last few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition mort@@ on still bre@@ eds salad , but he now needs longer , since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a bou@@ lder would lie in a river to whom I must d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far to sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in front of the court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the sort Out@@ red@@ dies in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative fÃ¼r &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ Saat@@ gut ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have grown from them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who purchase seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not sell it immediately - two aspects that are banned and prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food safety and environmental protection .
it is said that seeds play a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , corn , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets , should also know that the manner in itself , as this vegetables is bred , is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant attributes .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si @-@ Supp@@ or@@ ters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , shr@@ inks constantly .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has been working in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it possible for plant bre@@ eders to be used either at all or only difficult .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ r@@ ots .
a Ques@@ tion of Visi@@ ons
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those that improve their taste or color to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for bre@@ eders decreases due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predi@@ ctive due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto det@@ ects that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is setting up for the preservation of genetic diversity .
it contradi@@ cts however , that intellectual property limits other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ables promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ends , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but Mort@@ on &apos;s main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
all in all Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of &quot; patented plant attributes : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics itself .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if one bre@@ eds a variety , it also bre@@ eds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , bre@@ eds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need constant new material for my catalogue , since I know that my ri@@ vals sell my grades in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years , making it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
although the U.S. seems to be leaders in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , condu@@ cts an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional farm plants , the Centre with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally grown plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ vos hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed system , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , which should be the official starting signal for the planned next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is cultivated and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who were supposed to defend the law and to give a vote in this part of the world . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block and not to yield . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al J@@ aze@@ era &apos;s Qatar network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles that he writes not to accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up was to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ oring machine , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider where also Zi@@ adas blog is home , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photographic journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege state ; an arrest , an addi@@ cted murder , sum@@ mons from the national security council , the locking blogs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now after they locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
furthermore , af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible by wra@@ pping internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and fil@@ tering content on which Egyptian users might have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian people no legal basis to act against these acts in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are quar@@ rel@@ ing .

day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day , a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rau@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the papers for their decision explained the paper in such a way :
extra will continue to report about crimes happening in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision was not an event for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war@@ time discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mean more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to hold responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ tion@@ ate negle@@ ct of the public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these safety policies also included the establishment of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP became increasingly under fire after several reports of c@@ ic@@ anes and repression against the poor municipalities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio is also attra@@ cting serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an in@@ viol@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ins@@ ane bul@@ lets . &quot;
war on or off , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas do continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
amid all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helic@@ opter .

to stay alive : anim@@ ated Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screenshot aus dem Werbe@@ video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad regime vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis loyal troops .
according to victory World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib .
the region East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , causing residents to rely on locally produced or through tun@@ nels and control points of mu@@ g@@ ged food@@ stu@@ ffs .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach East Gh@@ out@@ as inhabitants as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we op@@ ted for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting this project for three years and expressed his relief that it is now more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a bath . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fra@@ cture of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to swe@@ ep new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October and called for justice for the victims of the fires that ra@@ mp@@ ed in the north of Portugal during the week .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured following the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a national mour@@ ning from solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia Region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached .
in June Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande took a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European for@@ estry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civilian protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ eign from the Bund der Landwir@@ te in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are ques@@ tioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to happen if the applicant compl@@ ained about means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , appear , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence Policy of Portugal on 15 and 16 October when people searched for information or tried to contact members offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the people : they used the own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires : the website was more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say so , she knew she would not see her son anymore - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ enc@@ eless .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his li@@ veli@@ hood .
at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran has been shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not fro@@ ze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high inci@@ dence quot@@ as Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which may take months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his innocent CV helped A@@ shar@@ af to release himself from these conditions .
after having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ per stuck his entire savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua , and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ ap@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

the Egyptian parliament sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zes a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users must register to use social networks within six months of succ@@ es@@ ful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stat@@ ing their full name and identity number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the clearing of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in May , in which tough@@ er sanctions would be introduced to the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the President and state institutions is already criminal . however , under the legislative proposal , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , it can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would strengthen a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exer@@ ted violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan had four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and addi@@ ctive murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in Giza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ si@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties from the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ es@@ ischer activ@@ ist inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
may , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly condemned to a well @-@ le@@ aked action plan . according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia has expressly backed a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of am@@ ne@@ sty , provided that they all return illeg@@ ally received money .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the prev@@ ent@@ ative plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the nom@@ ination of his sources , stat@@ ing Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code , which rep@@ lied rep@@ or@@ ters the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 9th as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to present their identity ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , in the regulations it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts susp@@ ect that by elimin@@ ating anonymous comments in conversations within social networks , it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizens journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship in Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the provincial government as &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Management . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government organiz@@ es a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make disc@@ ern@@ ing services responsible for removing content and forcing them to susp@@ end user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ Kontakte and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ speaking items , the declar@@ ations that Turkey support the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source working with groups to create a political diff@@ ra@@ ction campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is therefore , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has cons@@ ented to telec@@ oms companies and intelligence services on the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
