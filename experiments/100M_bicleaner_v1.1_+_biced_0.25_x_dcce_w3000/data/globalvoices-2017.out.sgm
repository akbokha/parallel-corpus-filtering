<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run their sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist, mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in comments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential election was the highest number that had ever reached a nominee nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist's program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumps world view did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(meaning" "" "whites against all other ethnicities" "" "; pun from white in allusion to whites and whiplash, which means so much as Schleudertrauma), as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White Americas has this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd browned." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried out and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocal "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaan town Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de m√∫sica (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse and violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bucket you learn the day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, wood horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 km south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with revisited instruments, made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler began to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of Favio Ch√°vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the initial period:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "the" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world." ""</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is carried out as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in Liberia, before it looked for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to tap one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permission.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied all" "", "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishermen's authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded in FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that at the time had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other, where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to detect. this means that illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disrespect of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those pointing out that a ship sends its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a catch license, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishing coming into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices, including sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, specification of fancy names, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You must not start my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Comm to me" "". "and just this legal loophole tries to close the FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that shared counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be localized by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and Oceana, a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who what is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project, in which a global system allows prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously had to fish without licence and had little to face consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">When FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board Schleppnetze, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There have been six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be produced in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used by dragging nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are protesting against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol√°s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions of M√©rida and T√°chira, in the central north-north federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol√°s Maduro, but eventually the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne D√≠az, co-contributor at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decree as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new governance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The voting alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called upon the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on 27 October, as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on November 3.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="181">The women in T√°chira have no skirts because you could see anything else what many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the degree of oppression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview by Alejo G√≥mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on D√≠a a D√≠a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of C√≥rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man Quijano now said in the course of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of C√≥rdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 was subjected to crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he watched at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called for me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a asshole, you have friends with one of the ERP friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass just that they don't kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later, he took me to work at the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine. my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">The first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were dropped and chatted with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are being tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spake in, and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were attached to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the original text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate the English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language to translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies which do not have any foreign employees, nevertheless make translations in company-internal. then the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sworn and puzzling sentences originating from mechanical translations show that this technique can still not replace human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling printouts that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless than jewellery. but by big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city Kyoto hopefully uses a more serious source of translation in the future.</seg>

<seg id="394">Also other online transmitters carried photos of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionist groups that the government Nicol√°s Maduros resisted.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and delegated the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos D√≠az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a tracer. he pointed out that the connection was capped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="405">Earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had found that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains faulty.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds error or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or her underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned here, however, is that the children must carry out homework for it that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>

<seg id="427">She spoke to Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by criadazgo's practice - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>

<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest against protest and demanded that "no other Carolina" should be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>

<seg id="453">If the case comes before the Court, the case of Carolina Mar√≠n could be directional - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas aren't only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers now had to work all work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunci√≥n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished her learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food." "" "I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge," "" "she remembers." ""</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "in some evenings the owner Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as" "" "Sendero" "" "or" "" "El Pueblo" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he held it intelligent, but not with her." "" "the owner had found someone listening while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would" "" "learn" "" "bad habits there." "" "they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guarani, would again speak their mother tongue guaran√≠." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they allowed her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which is almost never spoken are bullying and the icans who are exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time when friendships emerge, I feel particularly clear that I belong to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">"" "the isolation was the worst of all," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cu√±adazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay), the Spanish conquerors who enslaved the conquerors of the Spanish conquerors, and the Mens√∫ "system (where the workers were considered to be Halb slaves), and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery, where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image by Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently voted on a draft bill on "Regulations in terms of use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when adopted by the Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt by a government agency to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up that is tasked to use citizens" "" "permission to use social media" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "within six months with the adoption of the law users would have to register with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a bucket.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application running and used on the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up registration. it is not clear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to secure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar MEP, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password to get through the firewall, blocked Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to invade a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to access information on their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Chief Scientist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they pretend that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will establish a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislative of parliament and constitutional committees, before entering into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in the Parliament, in which the control is maximized and that no deviant narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, parliamentarians Tamer El Shahawy proposed a law against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was provided for those found guilty of threatening the "public order" and "protest."</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still is the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Prefecture of Miyagi was a great prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Prefecture of Fukushima preached a nuclear accident, already alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been reached six years later to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The report provides detailed information on the number of deals and their value categorized into deal types, sub-sector and regions.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement buildings were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsensw√É ften, evacuated from Behelfsensw√É ften, Kazakhstan, kasetsu juutaku, can be found in final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuation of Fukushima live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, who had breathed after the disaster in homes, were resettled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have been resumed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have excelled passively.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 ha of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the nuclear barrier zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here again Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that almost half of the coastal inhabitants have since the catastrophe more difficult to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to find an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her reception changed vis-√†-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken steps to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disastrous-caused, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced.</seg>
<seg id="578">More than 160,000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 60,000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the evacuation, which still lives in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. they fail to return to proper accommodation, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of √Ålvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers closed doors all over Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio Arle√© Ma√±alich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still, and the factory gradually lost its plants, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some rarely changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigrated and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region sugar cane manufacturers exist, which are in operation after a long period of inactive time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls precisely to have heard that in Ma√±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly viable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production targets were 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars will remain between 15 and 16 centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agriculture perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely come into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane manufacturers, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arl√©e Ma√±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto P√©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially contained documents, which were distinguished only in regard to the parts which would be removed, the Adressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any escape.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation," he insures.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop thus becomes apparent that the young participants in discussions like" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the tribe of the Kitsum alkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen most indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapakstui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a stophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "this is the day when you will receive our cry." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way of life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastics models of the dishes") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves as these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin gentpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new with plastic rubbish decorated cell phones, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu shop.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food items have been transformed into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin radiator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essentials is becoming increasingly more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaise-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ICURA or Salmon rogen is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melt ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic items can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to hashtag # 2</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of in- and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the suspects and perpetrators are regularly appearing in statistics. these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug trafficking like El Chapo Guzm√°n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learn with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were caught in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal pol√≠tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "" "" "organized crime not only lets us fear our lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodr√≠guez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal pol√≠tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass through newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "it is unbelievable for me, if the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" "" "resident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to imagine that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four month blackmail in Hauptstadtdistrikt": how a family has been looted with threats. "it describes how armed criminals press money from their business month by month, until they had destroyed not only the business, but also had torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain on it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report in the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the post "The Uncharted Children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, soak potatoes, warm tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been past two years earlier, when he had only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings, according to the Government of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this equals 8.5 morals per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal pol√≠tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is that after something the first time has appeared? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false Context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of impact holes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank trolley dropped to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representative described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people who watched the football world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das ist Nigeria." vom Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonated bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been tipped several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities, in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops have been burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerges from the DR Congo, when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the DR Congo is only one in a series of misprints; Africa check has documented orders relating to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning announcement, published by the United Nations, those who flee could flee blows, rape and many dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi-Arab news site, which falsely claimed 2012, the president of Myanmar's Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians involved themselves in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater debates about the silence associated with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been extensively discussed (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the resignation of images of a refusal comes to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot about discussing violent accounts in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used by the context or in a completely misunderstood way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of wrong write-ups should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or even impossible to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Look around your parents in recognition of how they tried to keep you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil like:</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narratives wants to preserve urban variety</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Recently, Global Voices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unsettable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening often to" "" "listening" "" "these events instead" "" "listening" "" "to appreciate, to feel, to socialize." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format story-tellers first present their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation will lead to the fact that the audience can be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video, for example, shows a traditional tale of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story-telling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march was launched at the Capitol, the capital's government building, and went down to the Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neuro-audit of debt) and the ecumenical assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>

<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open web.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference for digital culture, hosted in Berlin, an event was dedicated to the # FreeBel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">M√©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara R√ºhling, managing director of book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available free of charge here contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the motions for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-consuming extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken part on a "strictly secret" command of the military court in his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels had cultural prototypes more predictable than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here the Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">So far Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other incarnates to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a proverb that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the start of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director after release of corruption again at previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted angrily to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace after half of his prison sentence in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants because of impairment of 54 million years (around 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post as the company did not perform a disciplinary procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle strongly condemned the company's decision to resign the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to note is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, seems to have no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Eg√≠dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "contrary" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had left half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and pollute his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is willingly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Irrevocably!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I cannot believe that one reward someone in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza misses morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served only himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself was weary of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Ze√∫te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belonged to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison, not only to remain in memory for the Mozambique as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people's East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective 'Indian.'</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censored the word "Kalar" or accelerated jargon soup as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely decreasing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts describing the use of the word have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, 'Kalar htaing' is written on Burmese, which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hts is the opinion that it will diminish hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical, before it deletes all postings that arise in suspicion of rracism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook solves the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words.</seg>

<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, the hate speech spread, receive quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "now it is time to cut off their nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy does not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I came to this new policy from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was told the Liken, posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail doesn't correspond to the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinions on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asked for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "genetic curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts.</seg>

<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, in social networks, hate speech is meant to heighten violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for its failure to control the proliferation of hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked more current, more in context than in code focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage network, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrythad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), had gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not intervene, since the age of age does not determine maturity.

<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements striving to abolish children's marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion so broadly, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we, instead of speaking of the problem, would simply talk that the state, our daughters would protect that they may be misused by large, hard-beaten men who are opposed to them, "would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-related Internet users are used to use wrapper tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform placed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "the content is available, despite legal prohibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we do everything to copy snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralised and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has brought about tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar errors if logged in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan-Digigrahi's Open Speak "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepalese animal world onto the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how he was able to help him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to gnat pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to collaborate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as fearful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood by face to face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzz appeared. he immediately sets out, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly in a tent to make recordings of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he took a photo of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state of Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not mention the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less evidence to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, became a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal Campaign, which is run by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the degradation of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices such as child marriage to exile from HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they maintain all dutities and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try at home at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only consented to her during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in Adrenaline rush about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the carcinoid-red dot if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped carrying it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who they could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never really talked about some things such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's ok, but some wanted a salwar spa, a wide shirt over a pants, wear; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped talking about the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hull for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of people for organ trafficking, presumably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of Zamb√©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the area of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and some of the organs were taken out.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man can contain gold or bring wealth, the spokesperson of the police officer of Zamb√©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that consecutive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of decrees for obscure purposes, are people with alcoholism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN 2016 to conduct a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, the Mosambian police warned about the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the Milange district, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM thinks that the shamans are involved in the death of men's men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zamb√©zia, for probably superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also acknowledges that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power the riches of riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha reported on Facebook the chronicles of the bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Mozambique is facing:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I would like to call A MOSABIK, THE SICH, a country in which people would have shame to go onto the street, dressed as chewing sex against good grades, and even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or "black magic" would be hunted, which aim to achieve instant wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese president, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>

<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon voyage to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price.</seg>

<seg id="1665">Liu Anwalt told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Association of Lawyers, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... No one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, you can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of it, it was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam there were answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried the corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "", "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unimportant even if we enjoyed free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of those cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said.</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correct and aware of what he is defending.</seg>

<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "credible a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesperson?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification mostly follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians cook perhaps inwardly with anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians are different from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and lawns live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the county was 16.000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 approximately 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms Ram√≠rez tells the people to come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "where are you Mum Africa?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are talking about Whatsapp of Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he responds smiling." "" "we will always stay in contact." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ram√≠rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian belief is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ram√≠rez is well known here, but she is not the only sparks hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have been living in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>

<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she puffs with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care, which she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification where they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app is" "" "preventing it from getting access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities also used the app for more than fighting terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict regions, the authorities often order extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet, based on Twitter based media outlet, "images from mainland China," published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checked out whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official jingwang-app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "", "also published a Jingwang product description, which emerges from the fact that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and the parties affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he calms to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felityees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25 Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can feel at home with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special tendency against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," is what he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a human being poured into two cups dissolved in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gnomes of lukewarm coffee and the cheering of the cent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a open-air prison, especially when one throws a glimpse into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan's water - to not land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of Interior Jordan announced a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concession.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "was canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila prioritized the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to be campaigning for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallising reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender norms to portray his vision of the fate of Arab women who marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently destroyed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorable Morses' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is compounded by the lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in adequate ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime of crime dating from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of infamatory violence can "be imprisoned in prison for indefinite time," and for their release, there is often a long-term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to shy away from themes that are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he states that he can't separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression of opinion, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was intimidated to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which, in his words, "what you want," be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + -individuals have been strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to remember that his comments were torn down, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not escape Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuff, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poem.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuff, who later should work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila' or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance, with the grounds that they had critically expressed comments in social media about the problems that were deeply rooted in the land.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now led Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approached by means of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, scattering unitions and democracies led to artificial nature. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to carry on and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warlords are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory says that the trolleys, drums and dancing marched over more than one thousand years, marched in the Northeast of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emission-hi.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two feats are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where road smoking and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and hence the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more normal people go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy School, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and receive training in the hairdressing room instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered by dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters," published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P√°rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign called Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombian, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, has to take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He tarried, told him to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former militants of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"" "" "" "I never thought that someone would forgive me" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they didn't receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can run through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," "" "told Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed over the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL Granatwerfer, a lethal weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I answered him anyway and said," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranches.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger death. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes for new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the FARC leaders explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State affects the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing a political party, we can help shape society in this country more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people, whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate, were only people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo Gonz√°lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to intervene and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won several months ago by the international headlines after reports published which thematized the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she sensed that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chetschenen had experienced from the sex embleation of her landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Fearing her life she moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya, which can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the turn of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was just doing a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying," "" "Here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you scarlet?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses were you laid - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of an alphabet.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running out the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, a car with a darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95 m was standing under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">I don't want to give up their names for security reasons, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're in security just because you've left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you plug in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian items I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid injuring her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give myself trouble to look like the person that she reminds of her past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those that have stood still?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told me that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "with this I mean, they probably charge relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there gay men now still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to make Cadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it so far. we suspect however that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia has never jammed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechnya language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity are you going on now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I escorted them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't waste a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people by myself when I appoint refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is true.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion purely.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same thing as Chechens, who wish to prophesy to you with foam before the mouth, that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the rodents have which, the cabiners have which, the Russians also have; on the whole planet there is - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transition identities to males who love males, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different ways - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, such as Ahmad human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani's hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short while later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ahmadinei minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmad Centre for Human Rights reported that a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have been hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to live their families due to the persecution from the Iranian government, and felt unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Ahzazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and 1925 had great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahviz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuse the Ahraazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams that run water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroying the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Directorate of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahmad's who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic performers and anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab ancestor will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aiming at crushing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihoods beyond their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahmad and so disguised, since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestry must endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement authored by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afrof√©minas website. article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that despite the same education women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in diverse areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to terms of skin colour, on racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or to black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racial violence that we are exposed to black women in a two-way way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and towns earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background more often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all men, all men and all men do not have the same rights of any skin colour whatsoever; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in which centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate to both the gender and the colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women repeatedly and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and marginalized being in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to differentiate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recrulaiming (example: Africa-Womanism: how we can recapture ourselves) speaks that we can defend ourselves by defining spaces in which they are completely safe and where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected person.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada B√°ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent to her.</seg>

<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the acclaimed advert of Ada B√°ez was useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman pulled back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women at all permit an advertisement, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must register at all by law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalts1 Strikes and Statistical 2 Unvisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"" "it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay." "" "there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay" "", "she explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the District Attorney Office received 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, 86% of women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were abused physically, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who refundeth ad due to physical abuse, there are two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">As the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists count at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she gave birth to psychic violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult identifiable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too servile because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report the ill-treatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos herself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him before.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original draft constitution had provided the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if it simply refuses to provide an indication and to obtain a safe place of residence to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>

<seg id="2536">Here an outline must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: for a lack in the supply of global health, many medicines and vaccines are missing, which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic demonstrated first grave effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian public health system.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GF: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding Salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own resourceful and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or milled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition morton still breeds salad, but he now needs longer, since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder would lie in a river to whom I must dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far to salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in front of the court, no one can breed a new salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the sort Outreddies in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT sector would come from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative f√ºr "Open-Source" -Saatgut) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have grown from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who purchase seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not sell it immediately - two aspects that are banned and prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">It is said that seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and participates in the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are being offered on farmers markets, should also know that the manner in itself, as this vegetables is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, shrinks constantly.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has been working in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it possible for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those that improve their taste or color to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders decreases due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictive due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto detects that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is setting up for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts however, that intellectual property limits other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varietables promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent expends, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But Morton's main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all Morton interfered with the concept of "patented plant attributes:" we do not really create the characteristics itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if one breeds a variety, it also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, breeds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patenting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patrons: "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constant new material for my catalogue, since I know that my rivals sell my grades in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years, making it very easy for my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the U.S. seems to be leaders in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, conducts an "open-source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional farm plants, the Centre with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeders differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. this speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally grown plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for the" "" "Open Source" "" "seed system, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" "" "Open Source" "" "seed systems, which should be the official starting signal for the planned next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that the Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true despite this attack and the mocking of Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who were supposed to defend the law and to give a vote in this part of the world. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block and not to yield. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's Qatar network because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of web pages offences to the victim. @ anhri one of the main sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes not to accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up was to circumvent the Egyptian government's censoring machine, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider where also Ziadas blog is home, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photographic journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege state; an arrest, an addicted murder, summons from the national security council, the locking blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Furthermore, afte also documented the blocking of providers, which was possible by wrapping internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian people no legal basis to act against these acts in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day, a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "thieves rauben pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio, published on August 16, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which they announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The papers for their decision explained the paper in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes happening in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the "War in Rio" section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision was not an event for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a wartime discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "mean more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira argues against violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to hold responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-complactionate neglect of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2781">These safety policies also included the establishment of UPP (Unidade de Pol√≠cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the Federal State Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP became increasingly under fire after several reports of cicanes and repression against the poor municipalities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio is also attracting serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil war is an inviolable point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "insane bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or off, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas do continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by Assad regime vis-√†-vis loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, causing residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of mugged foodstuffs.</seg>

<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say so, she knew she would not see her son anymore - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0 | CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, always came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran has been shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not froze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high incidence quotas Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which may take months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocent CV helped Asharaf to release himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Asharper stuck his entire savings to the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">"" "Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of documentary" "" "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" "" "(German:" "" "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy" "" ") of the director Amin Wahidi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua, and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharaps aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament scrutinizes a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of succesful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the clearing of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in May, in which tougher sanctions would be introduced to the president or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the offence of the President and state institutions is already criminal. however, under the legislative proposal, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, it can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would strengthen a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exerted violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 Protestants who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan had four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges of including weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and addictive murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage of the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adasiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the penalties from the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunesischer activist interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly condemned to a well-leaked action plan. according to the plan, Ben Gharbia has expressly backed a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of amnesty, provided that they all return illegally received money.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat sheds light on how the preventative plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused the nomination of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which replied reporters the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, in the regulations it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that by eliminating anonymous comments in conversations within social networks, it is unclear until now, how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only enforce these regulations in order to protect citizens journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, state censorship in Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register in the provincial government as "Organizer of Information Management."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government organizes a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make discerning services responsible for removing content and forcing them to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites such as VKontakte and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service Mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court decreed the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to erase two English-speaking items, the declarations that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, maritime affairs and communication announced that the site was closed because it became "an information source working with groups to create a political diffraction campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is therefore, in addition to China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers, which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consented to telecoms companies and intelligence services on the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until 19 May. reactions and proposals from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
