that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA copied illegal phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sur@@ rendered to Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not coinci@@ de at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years the government has been determined against cra@@ cks and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condem@@ n and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the brave ones they give .
so when the government approached cra@@ cks , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ or@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , despite years of information that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ or@@ ters and sources can always be less hidden .
instead of elimin@@ ating and breaking the cra@@ cks , they could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secre@@ tly worried about his telephone directories ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his loan agreement , and even travel advice with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional provision , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows rep@@ or@@ ters to b@@ yp@@ ass the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today , there is communication software that has not yet been written when the cra@@ cks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source medi@@ ation system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , the Aaron Swar@@ tz written by us , and has now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the here of the Washington Post .
you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us .
it &apos;s up to us to make sure that not only technological know @-@ men such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to get mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who strikes alert to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the greatest Daten@@ le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that king@@ doms and susp@@ ects &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax hav@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has entered tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a US $ 2 billion mark leads Russian President Vladimir Putin to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others waiting for the next release , and on the next exposed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling something we have been discussing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the U.S. about this matter .
pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax hav@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States allows employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ ds to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Bar Companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all of us had made suggestions to a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
none of these attor@@ neys took us as a client , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leader , ent@@ an@@ gled in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very v@@ ow as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite certain that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years , we have seen a tendency towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been regi@@ stering in central regi@@ sters at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ran out and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you asleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I see ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sh@@ red@@ ded on toe at the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me depends on his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my viewpoint .
perhaps the people , who were sold to me as stran@@ gers in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost pl@@ under@@ ing , my ro@@ omm@@ ate is moving out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a work desk included , including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and so &quot; Air Matt@@ resses and Breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite alien people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited that the mis@@ sile would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still at Tro@@ st would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ? why ?
because as children we all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one disc@@ erns the things one can do well . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design do such things ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were aiming for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to know that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone to your left sitting ro@@ omm@@ ate .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once , who now actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please Twitter telling that he is can@@ did@@ ly candidate for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ g@@ ments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to submit your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to aband@@ on negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their app@@ rais@@ als before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence .
little surprisingly , we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bl@@ ends common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you buy .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I am making holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disc@@ ard those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need which had not been met before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything is going smoothly .
there were guests who in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem .
because people trusted each other rightly .
when trust works , mira@@ culous can occur .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels , who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by .
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not work .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions ?
it is here an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sharing economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people place part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , it &apos;s easy to compare with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a Knei@@ pp neighborhood of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape apartments from ground to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students looking for a place of stay ,
were taught to people whose children had moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ators have been launched ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have decided to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ ling with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , ques@@ tioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive is fully understood , and yet somehow in love ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ meldung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into in@@ dig@@ nation .
why should this be done ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember when we drove silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognised as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations which said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ eive you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims assembled to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged into the free and sm@@ ote them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have beaten the anger of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also fur@@ ious .
it is not easy to have to explain yourself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close Mos@@ ques .
they talk of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ ners and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking space available , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ c@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radi@@ c@@ alisation process , it has been noted that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still pret@@ end that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations , when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual one with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution .
this I@@ mam establishes the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if you submit papers , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were more likely to voice military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic issue .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ aps against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hear the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the case of the assignment of collective gu@@ ilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his res@@ ume . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying at home safely ?
we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the sh@@ als , and what I saw , left me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congreg@@ ations were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ atis@@ m ?
will you be safe on number ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with a drau@@ ght , working in a cl@@ assy mind@@ set , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people like an exception are usually released , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about getting a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ par@@ ting entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . several years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting , flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must be collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest flat@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseud@@ om@@ u@@ gi@@ l c@@ f. p@@ ask@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red ne@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position reg@@ ains and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remot@@ ely controlled aircraft , which only had two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented short ago .
it only has a moving part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inner life happens very much so that it can be stable , and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to get it flying , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when all of you watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is β@@ isch symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the normal ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s take a look at that .
when flying machines are part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ pitch prop@@ ellers .
this is clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance crossover .
however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ ellers falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if restricted .
we will demonstrate it now by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- each one weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations inspire you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da gl@@ itter wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creation .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes have cir@@ cled in a very far away galax@@ y , and they converted the mass of three Suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe known to us .
it was a very big bang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events chron@@ ologically .
1.3 billion years ago there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God gives us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a giant laser det@@ ector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o was considerably increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ector start @-@ up , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the earth &apos;s two col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my to@@ d@@ sick father .
in fact , that was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like lig@@ o @-@ meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a manifestation in the structure of space and time .
when sur@@ passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and st@@ acked into the other .
for illustration , lectur@@ ers in courses for theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a correctly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and du@@ ck , stretch and du@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and spra@@ yed at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . this is why we declared the Lig@@ o employees crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
THOR@@ NE published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
for sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot :
for example , the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just speaking Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for quite a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ ping simply : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies rot@@ ate very quickly , one h@@ ears the same circulation with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of movement addi@@ tive , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognis@@ es this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 stars , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ves one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a new way to research the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ponds in super nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the big bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the urine is covered by its own night @-@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea of . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the sour no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists in being as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be ni@@ cer than to listen to the big bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , bringing me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do when I was afraid I removed my fear .
my fear of keeping words , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected style . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sag@@ a to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life .
it is a dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
it is a dream job .
I scre@@ am TV . I &apos;m producing TV .
I make television , in a big style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts at the same time : 24 episo@@ des : Grey &apos;s , 21 episo@@ des : sc@@ andal , 15 episo@@ des : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episo@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not just produced , so still ob@@ late . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a tit@@ anium .
it is a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just lying around the computer and fant@@ asi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that this dream job does not dream about .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
as you dream of a high tone , a marathon can be found .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturb@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go on her forever .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the sums -- when I started television production , when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the sums !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t want to be different from size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called &apos; ego &apos; .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a tit@@ anium and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episo@@ des , the more hi@@ ring boundaries , the more work there , the more work there , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that her m@@ um is a single work place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ onda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming stopped .
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same tit@@ anic work , 15 hours of days , well @-@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a tit@@ anium does not sleep , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ down @-@ tit@@ anium ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heu@@ l dich aus , stupid author @-@ tit@@ anium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a bank@@ ers , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sums , and know how the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a tit@@ anium ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things are aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ als are bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of hum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy stroke comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly da , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a sum .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the working @-@ sum , the tit@@ anium @-@ sum , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television hours and how oper@@ able my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on pleasure .
the real hum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a tit@@ anium ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as easy as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of person is better than being at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we hur@@ ry around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we rag@@ ged soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always access my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cu@@ it replaces me .
and talking to me my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no longer needs it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes a day , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children get ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there is no need to be the children . it is true to feel the sums , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong to it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the sums of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only part of it . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a tit@@ anium . I &apos;ve never seen a tit@@ anium to go to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sw@@ amp , the sum , the other , the real sums , the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , engaging , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less tit@@ anium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
they have certainly heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; this im@@ plant an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circu@@ it@@ ry so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that cran@@ ial @-@ brain trau@@ ma trig@@ gers the brain and increases cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life one has to dimin@@ ish the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ? why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
you may also know from the study of biology that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the separation of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then marking them far@@ blich , in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the removal point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we used in vit@@ ro , in culture .
here we could of course not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills sector in the motor vehicle Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen to people , they spont@@ aneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ ty brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and later use them .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can use it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill approximately two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ plex trial .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable devot@@ ion .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy f@@ ades in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vocal to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not influence austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would alter anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group er@@ ron@@ eous a mistake , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies will be bl@@ ur@@ red , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt denberg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ks and corporations , who are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income which could produce the debt burden and also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion dollars have been invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tril@@ lion dollars that were around the same time in the same countries as well as our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ame the stock market and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which is not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployment , and consequently a low aggregate demand that advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus &apos;s father who is out of fear , the proph@@ ecy of the O@@ mis@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ unt@@ ary the circumstances that cause Ö@@ di@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
its most extravag@@ ant art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she moved the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which she gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in matters of state affairs .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long held --
like a candle that lights up very bright , it is quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present @-@ day democra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ or@@ able struggle between the two is taking place , while the economy is gradually under@@ going politics and escap@@ ing it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my v@@ eins with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ zed politics so far that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods will be de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful of capitalism the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; ret@@ ains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and w@@ asting .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts lower , just as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end in a disease @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which machines serve people and the human beings bury their energy into the research of the universe , or indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it look like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one employer to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from rede@@ mption and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no differentiation between those who belong to the company , but which do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong . no longer exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no superior twin summit .
in the sphere of global political economy , please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time we did not have the technical means to implement it .
today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno ban@@ ani PRO@@ MET@@ H@@ EU@@ S T @-@ Shirt
you describe yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that is why I am totally confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not hosting you don &apos;t think about enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what to keep from the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- let us remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now to do what the West has done in the nin@@ ete@@ enth century , sm@@ ells of violence according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you return six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive recycling line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have also elected den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to sust@@ ain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one might delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you expect ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its constitution .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he said he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders , which imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the un@@ le@@ ashed troops will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to introduce the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ ger and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course this is a highly competitive industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are located right on this corner .
this curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addi@@ ctive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episo@@ des ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average pay@@ out , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t wow .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon publ@@ ishes stuff for nothing , then you access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episo@@ des .
however , they don &apos;t know they are watching when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and the answer is , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of arran@@ ging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the ratings they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together , they entered a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
we have two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works fine for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will decide if a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the data of the most sealed companies are wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that it can predi@@ ct out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to comp@@ ose parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , then to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but deciding how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV @-@ ideas , than they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Ques@@ tion you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a tech@@ no demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in retro@@ sp@@ ect on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this is a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
