<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA copied illegal phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA surrendered to Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not coincide at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years the government has been determined against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblower to condemn and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they can't protect the identity of the brave ones they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government approached cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, despite years of information that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always be less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of eliminating and breaking the cracks, they could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly worried about his telephone directories,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his loan agreement, and even travel advice with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government ranks too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional provision, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows reporters to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that has not yet been written when the cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source mediation system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, the Aaron Swartz written by us, and has now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's up to us to make sure that not only technological know-men such as Edward Snowden have a chance to get misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee who strikes alert to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the greatest Datenleck of history was published.] [the Panama Papers "reveal that kingdoms and suspects] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosley Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosley Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has entered tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a US $2 billion mark leads Russian President Vladimir Putin to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others waiting for the next release, and on the next exposed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their assets in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing something we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the U.S. about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosley Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States allows employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigator to the offices of 13 Bar Companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all of us had made suggestions to a lawyer to our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these attorneys took us as a client, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single leader, entangled in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very vow as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite certain that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years, we have seen a tendency towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been registering in central registers at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy to stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost ran out and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you asleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "what do I do now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Ah, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I see?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed, shredded on toe at the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me depends on his classroom today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people, who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plundering, my roommate is moving out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a work desk included, including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "Ha!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and so "Air Mattresses and Breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite alien people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still at Trost would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one discerns the things one can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do such things?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were aiming for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to know that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who now actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please Twitter telling that he is candidly candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgments that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to submit your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their appraisals before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation blends common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you buy.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "Great works of art in your apartment! I am making holidays with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to discard those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need which had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is going smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who infiltrated parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miraculous can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels, who save lives, even though they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay does not work.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply called" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Sharing economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, it's easy to compare with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a Kneipp neighborhood of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from ground to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students looking for a place of stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children had moved out. incubators have been launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="274">"" "" "" "I have decided to do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.</seg>

<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking space available, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalisation process, it has been noted that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the extremists group can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still pretend that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Sacred Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual one with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam establishes the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if you submit papers, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were more likely to voice military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic issue.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swaps against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to hear the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the case of the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>

<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air-parting entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. several years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">That a system works autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest flate. e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device doesn't matter what position the optimal position regains and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented short ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inner life happens very much so that it can be stable, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to get it flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when all of you watch is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is βisch symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the normal ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-pitch propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance crossover.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propellers falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate it now by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations inspire you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da glitter wants to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes have circled in a very far away galaxy, and they converted the mass of three Suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-feelings and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events chronologically.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God gives us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a giant laser detector in order to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravitational wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo was considerably increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a last trial to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector start-up, the gravitational-waves roamed through the earth through the earth's two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In fact, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like ligo-measurable signals for 23 years. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a manifestation in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When surpassing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and stacked into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses for theory of relativity often perform a correctly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and duck, stretch and duck." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and sprayed at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. this is why we declared the Ligo employees crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">THORNE published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just speaking Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, chirping simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies rotate very quickly, one hears the same circulation with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement additive, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognises this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 stars, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolves one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a new way to research the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserponds in super novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the big bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the urine is covered by its own night-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that there exist in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea of. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, ligo found things right in the first attempt which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes as Ligo observes them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour noodles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the big bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "before whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, bringing me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do when I was afraid I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping words, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected style. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimation" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimating, I need milk for my beak-up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "Yes" saga to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">It is a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">It is a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I'm producing TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">"" "" "" "the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars." ""</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not just produced, so still oblate. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">It is a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you're managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I'm talking about work so you understand that I'm not just lying around the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that this dream job does not dream about.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As you dream of a high tone, a marathon can be found.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go on her forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started television production, when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you can't want to be different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called 'ego'.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a titanium and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more hiring boundaries, the more work there, the more work there, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, overstated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mum is a single work place.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "estimating, I want to go to Shonda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanic work, 15 hours of days, well-worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showdown-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "heul dich aus, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're doing, you're doing what you're doing, being a bankers, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the sums, and know how the buzzing stops when the buzzing stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no, when two things are aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "" "estimation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "estimation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my totals are betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of humming, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy stroke comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly da, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the working-sum, the titanium-sum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself through broadcasts and television hours and how operable my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what kind of person is better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "to be honest, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We hurry around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We ragged soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always access my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to me my teenie-daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, no longer needs it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes a day, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children get ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. there is no need to be the children. it is true to feel the sums, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "playing" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I fail and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to meet myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece, why not allow for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong to it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but only part of it. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a titanium to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the totals. the land I create, the marathon which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the swamp, the sum, the other, the real sums, the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, engaging, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." this implant an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the neurons' circuitry so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that cranial-brain trauma triggers the brain and increases cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life one has to diminish the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may also know from the study of biology that stem cells are immature cells, which can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the separation of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then marking them farblich, in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the removal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we used in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could of course not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills sector in the motor vehicle Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastity brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can use it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multiplex trial.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable devotion.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy fades in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocal to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not influence austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if they would alter anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup erroneous a mistake, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies will be blurred, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt denberg who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy sparks and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income which could produce the debt burden and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion dollars that were around the same time in the same countries as well as our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflame the stock market and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit which is not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployment, and consequently a low aggregate demand that advocates the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus's father who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Omisels could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary the circumstances that cause Ödipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its most extravagant art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and particularly finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that she moved the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which she gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in matters of state affairs.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long held --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up very bright, it is quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two is taking place, while the economy is gradually undergoing politics and escaping it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my veins with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, decimated that it is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has so far cannized politics so far that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods will be devalued, the inequality falls, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism the "demos" [the people] expels from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and wasting.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of waste, and social conflicts lower, just as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so, we need to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end in a disease-hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "appear as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve people and the human beings bury their energy into the research of the universe, or indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what would it look like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the" "" "matrix" "" "similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one employer to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those who belong to the company, but which do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong. no longer exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no superior twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- let us call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "Kosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time we did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno banani PROMETHEUS T-Shirt</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that is why I am totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not hosting you don't think about enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what to keep from the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- let us remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells of violence according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you return six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive recycling line went through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have also elected denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to sustain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one might delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you expect?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its constitution.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he said he did not make any mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the lenders, which imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you still seem to be pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, the unleashed troops will be demonic and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to introduce the way of a post-modern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will also be tolerable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thanks so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedger and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a highly competitive industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are located right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average payout, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't wow.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon publishes stuff for nothing, then you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are watching when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and the answer is, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of arranging a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, i.e. the ratings they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together, they entered a car and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">We have two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works fine for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will decide if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">"" "" "" "even the data of the most sealed companies are wrong." ""</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way, by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, then to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been capable of. but deciding how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards," that wasn't in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV-ideas, than they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This is the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a techno demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have heard in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this is a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
