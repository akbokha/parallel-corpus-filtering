Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ farmers cultivate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card game promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows , who had to be exciting because the car @-@ nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of a circum@@ ference road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria of State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not immediately recogni@@ zable as such .
in the big picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter , were incorporated into cities and communities .
these were produced according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and origin@@ ates from Bavaria &apos;s first survey .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria card .
Ele@@ ctor Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung .
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt für München dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
this is an example of this , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the west park is , one sees nothing as a field - at first sight : in the zo@@ oming a small @-@ scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered floo@@ d@@ gates from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the facility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen site , one reads not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you were once locked people with del@@ usions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ Renten@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ den headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients first place was first , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro @-@ sir@@ ens in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of the T@@ SV München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II by bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line route takes place .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publ@@ ishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for promoting farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a series of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based inci@@ dents occur l@@ ately throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately targets minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist transgres@@ sions against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken seriously by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 Mis@@ sour@@ i signed 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ chens &apos;s report , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for employment or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states passed immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violation , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing in the opinion of AC@@ LU .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the C@@ DU @-@ Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have gained a picture on the spot .
in the district court of the Schwen@@ demann family representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher C@@ DU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann provided insight into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative distribution path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
region@@ ales exclusively come to the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spontaneous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profitable on such a steep area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green areas ensure a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not lead a bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the for@@ est@@ ation of the land could be extended for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the surface is 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
from the total cost of approximately 71 500 Euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac emphasized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and ag@@ grav@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here are the best foods produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ sp@@ fle@@ geri@@ chts@@ ie ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg facilit@@ ates the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the prerequis@@ ite is the presence of a conveyor set drawn by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the en@@ umer@@ able area must not be min@@ ced ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ est@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 parking cells , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence for the Fish erb@@ acher project , is currently under construction .
the coverage area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have vo@@ wed him if he had done it .
but he took hold of their importance , and in particular the importance of which you were attributed as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added to his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta imp@@ lied , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you refer to , which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the sha@@ king words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your mills , your arms , and your oppressed masses , who desire to breathe free , / the mis@@ erable fall of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable fall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism , representing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical picture .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atis@@ m that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving ahead .
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the path , but ign@@ ite hatred , which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two Scot@@ ties belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director General of the UK &apos;s Athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain from the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought about were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete with their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir is on this track and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who should watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world champion@@ ships when the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
the crew captain says that she is &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the he@@ els of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from the internal policy to his political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ed in criticism , safe .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
ho@@ gans have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union rejected him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type of Hog@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to deci@@ ph@@ er his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans said Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail addressed some of the real people that were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans , Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news posting &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or canc@@ elling a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical le@@ clo@@ ths and to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is filed by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County ow@@ es the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writer struck up his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organiz@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rapha@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;

&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; Or@@ r said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at the time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonably close to time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which ob@@ stru@@ cts the construction work again and again , represents a major problem for the construction of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off bars is already huge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luck@@ ily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with hot mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the uncertain Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with dec@@ ep@@ tive water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule turned swi@@ ft@@ ly against the Government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea embra@@ ced the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that have been converted into different yel@@ lo@@ wish tones by r@@ ust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no aliens .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not ac@@ custom@@ ed to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood resources worth 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars in between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprison@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mass@@ ent@@ ö@@ tungen in Pap@@ u@@ as Stam@@ es@@ hoch@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) in the 1970 &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ oming Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ b@@ ane in 2016 , reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week &apos;s inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indon@@ esian researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have increased as Pap@@ u@@ as resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ck@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to work in the capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his 2014 campaign .
the former carp@@ enter sur@@ vey@@ ed 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the palace of Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jo@@ ko@@ wi in 2014 , with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai exp@@ ended only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ wis inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children had been outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children said they should turn their head@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers took imp@@ etus to their sound and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , h@@ unted and sm@@ ote the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of the children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried off cerem@@ onial h@@ un@@ ts and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in a circle continuously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters launched bricks on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are more than three times resist@@ ing , they shoot them , &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man of Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ finder spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they would be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks ago , Jo@@ ko@@ wi in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Wir@@ anto , Minister of Security Affairs , said in October 2016 that he submitted an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta with TIME on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fier@@ ce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police attacked vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing war@@ nings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by engaging spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ ductions from Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into cust@@ ody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to deal with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport in greater numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch Deputy Secretary of Asia , the promises of Jo@@ ko@@ wis have failed to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report Indon@@ esian un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Right Ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , bra@@ ced her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jo@@ ko@@ wi again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the Council of Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jo@@ ko@@ wi to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for yo@@ ko@@ wi as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a complex just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which you acci@@ dentally call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and when people cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.00 PM local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled down the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , interior trim for decoration or insulation came .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was not only supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport .
this is often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to safeguard the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applications .
not only for the vote , after many obj@@ ections , the proposal was already before the proposal to leave the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . , and players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the air@@ plane , find out a survey
a survey conducted among air passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent inten@@ tionally or un@@ consciously banned subjects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration pass by sm@@ ug@@ gling , including at least 6 percent who entered the air@@ plane while they acci@@ dentally carried out kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late discovered that they were mistakenly using fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from those ques@@ tioned that they were kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent that were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent reported knowing kno@@ w@@ ingly worn items with blades by security screening , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male ques@@ tioned also confirmed that they inten@@ tionally brought illegal drugs into the air@@ plane .
the company said it asked travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling goods had brought by airport security and how many had inten@@ tionally done it .
it is no surprise that people , the most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - unk@@ now@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids can take them or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far concluded that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn her non @-@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less da@@ unting figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 reservations for the new car whose extra@@ dition is just starting .
now Mus@@ k is admitted : the total of 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre @-@ orders had already been tra@@ ced back to 63@@ .000 .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
for a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom , 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reservation Pay@@ out . &quot;
currently 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are in place , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 84@@ .000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models are expected to be 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are required at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is too much delay , then the non @-@ binding ability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ happy customers from run away in flo@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back to the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency referred to the needs of state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint , which had been lifted up against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a term that went down on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth O@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of stri@@ c@@ ter environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations to resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ atory roll@@ back agenda &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a statement issued on Wednesday , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines for execution and then to be indi@@ cted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained of the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure was not set up in the Senate yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York Public Prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who accused the EPA of this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about a change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Kirche
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius site is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concerns .
Walter Martini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first documented in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg mit der Pfarr@@ kirche zu Tum@@ lingen together with the V@@ og@@ t@@ ei &quot; an Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the hill hill , apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard that belonged to the church or pat@@ ron@@ age law and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the underground village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the most glori@@ fied settlement of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the Early Middle Ages .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new minister to the Bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two bar@@ red at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were located near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche collap@@ sed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night , in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the tower and the half crashed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken down .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today remained a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite the friends and sponsors to Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is arranged by the com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ eis .
Director Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
to end the ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers put out the fantastic views .
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius site , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ er Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ Organis@@ er Walter Martini affir@@ ms .
association wants to appro@@ ve appro@@ vals of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( C@@ DU ) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind power concentration zone exists at the time in Vier@@ sen .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it , because of a lack of shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to withdraw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to concentrate the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been dealt with in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to investigate the matter again .
however , they do not pres@@ um@@ ably lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to submit to the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette for the construction of four wind turbines , each 200 meters high .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates in cash , had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are property .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashed : wife dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two other people were easily injured .
the provincial road was closed for hours .
after police investigations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car took the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and tra@@ ders plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the Gewerbe@@ verein und die Stadt@@ verwaltung intend to use the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre should invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ctive inner city &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fountain festival , including ready @-@ to @-@ sale Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ ders and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened again or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also had lost the city centre during shopping .
in the end all would have to contribute to li@@ king the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which partly broad@@ ened , the king had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day will take part in the first time in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities .
beside Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its direct environment with its buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire brig@@ ade , there was still an injury in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later found dead .
in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school .
as a matter of failure , the authorities pres@@ umed working on a gas pipeline .
during the holidays there were only a few people staying in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump translated into pier@@ ced tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a scheduled boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him of being publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and swe@@ pt over Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ pot &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump conclu@@ des the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for all day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ apping as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ s Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer , took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and glan@@ ced through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the dwell@@ ers ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man how@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es t@@ ore the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
luck@@ ily this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , was only a post @-@ order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience got very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Om@@ bud@@ sman came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were caught in 1946 by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that a injus@@ tice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want law enforcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blank@@ et on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com met a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that sm@@ ells in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent White Land@@ lord , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they approached the prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an elec@@ toral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , that will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual presentation of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vi@@ dly , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n because we are confronted with the ug@@ ly in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build relationships with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were crowded - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - in a room and listen , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief cl@@ an member for years , but he said that the role will never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room actors rehear@@ sed Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cona ch@@ ords the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s most lou@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ an@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thunder@@ ed one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people killed .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends ab@@ usive and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clo@@ thed with a sorrow , stands above the actors of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays to mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ as &apos;s de@@ pressing dam@@ p every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ok , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the post@@ ure with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski has strug@@ gled to find words which feel the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone stops Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds on civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is in some way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging from gigantic , six @-@ story cou@@ l@@ isse .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a m@@ ason@@ ry and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter posed as a rock @-@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil drums remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; stage .

brutal the scene when he beats the Siegfried .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly explo@@ its the hands of the Merkel @-@ rob@@ ber .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team had been anticipated with sus@@ pen@@ se .
in 2013 , he had to go on a rolling whi@@ stle @-@ concert about himself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of his perception .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work right at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture fair , once a week I hel@@ fe here in Greven at the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
amount : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does this work ?
amount : I did finish .
and then a building engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it like that ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Jugen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ unte@@ er Service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where to make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was just what prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating static calculations .
there are always other people in front of each other , who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee whether a young man has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son ab@@ brevi@@ ates more than 3.000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
job cuts , which announced the General Director John Fall@@ on for the most part in the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 39@@ 4 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ Attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died of the incident in the Q@@ Ara@@ ga district .
the bom@@ bing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that on Thursday evening the explosion happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worn by persons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable condition and treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field B@@ agram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Ara@@ g@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agram .
according to the United Nations , at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weak@@ ens the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environment Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that states are oblig@@ ated to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states compl@@ ained of the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we are respon@@ ding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulation - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions in a part of the country need to be measured in order to comply with stri@@ c@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tr@@ ump wants to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ crats and nature reserves who are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website states that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and can strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
congreg@@ ate wants a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ zeln appro@@ ves the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing land part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
it will still be that until now the church community has been owned by the church , there is no longer a planning obstacle for the project being st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council pret@@ end to have such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors of sen@@ iors , but openly to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent supported .
the proposed decision to signal the investor is that in this regard , it does not want to throw a ni@@ p@@ ples between the legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning towards the ambient lighting - as well as desk roof - which reduces tr@@ ash height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer writes , is this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he happens the committee .
it is not so easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one does not go so far , but now they lean at the communal room out of the window , says : &quot; I am doing so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy of any wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in doubt commerci@@ ally market@@ able counter value , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to appe@@ ase the proposal accordingly , there are three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two counter@@ parts in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make the decision so we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police reported , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder had been on the bicycle path of the black road from the direction of Hil@@ den at 12 : 20 o &apos;clock .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Langen@@ felder was on the road , he apparently didn &apos;t count on the opposite .
he met with a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospital with a retreat tro@@ l@@ ley .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game be su@@ cked against Dortmund .
with personnel wor@@ ries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory performance of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the kno@@ ck@@ out champion .
personnel wor@@ ries at the German Football Record Champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ sieger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain in du@@ el with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , the coin @-@ partners Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old however believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German football le@@ ague ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the Harz of Stern zu Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ war@@ te Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need@@ y of many tourists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inquiry che@@ eses St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
later the star trail is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers learn much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star sh@@ ines more light than another , although it is much further away .
in which con@@ stellation you will find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ ry wer@@ g - the planet path@@ way .
starting at Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg path takes its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the pl@@ anks with the individual planets - including the P@@ lu@@ to degra@@ ded P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - are set up exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a bullet of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 metres away measures 70 cm .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun to P@@ lu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , went down the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia looked out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you doing Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans are asking for .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko cons@@ ented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year , in order to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , after its light weight competition in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later op@@ ted openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side sees &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... You wanted to be the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show stroke , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tires
in an accident on the A7 , four people were injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the junction of the market .
the passenger sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he sur@@ passed and then left on the roof of the green strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be passed by the left lane to the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 at the start of the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , as not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the Drei@@ erk@@ ette should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a release , the lag@@ o@@ ons don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so that no one stands in line with Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , his team gets better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just finished in the Drei@@ erk@@ ette in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , but that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford so many fl@@ aws in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an un@@ decided start from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season will only be judged after six to eight match days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career preference in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guest from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favourite will go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are swe@@ eping it , only because we are entitled to come under the first six is stup@@ idity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , one must hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chief Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement is arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Evaluation Tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were at least the age @-@ old .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be less than 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would become 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , during x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 . in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , director at the Straßen@@ wesen und Verkehr im Regier@@ ung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three renovation @-@ need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Light is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault @-@ arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 meters long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border forti@@ fication , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a bridge cap of 2,20 meters is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way will take place .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building and the ra@@ mp in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated one lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher drive the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge restructuring costs amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est in German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the circle day ( C@@ DU , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that demonstrates this day peac@@ efully because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the lou@@ dly poster &quot; great elec@@ toral campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ che form the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the town pic@@ nick was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum One world and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ ped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle has various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers waiting for the pres@@ idency candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keeping their spe@@ eches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be told shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te morgen , Sonntag , um 8 Uhr in der Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che , ein Wieder@@ sehen mit dem Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ Trio Freder@@ ic B@@ elli gibt es in der Reihe Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te morgen , Sunday , um 8 Uhr in der Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
he is solo@@ ist of the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of various gen@@ res .
so Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music , together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try out everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into gr@@ illed cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette asks Dar@@ stell@@ erin to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have dat@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that they were bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or ob@@ stru@@ cted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suffered especially among them , but they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to tell her love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thou@@ ght@@ ful thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump , previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from doing so in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the final rejection of a party from above to bottom without guidance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed again in sports .
Russian Athle@@ tics Chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ano@@ int said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were s@@ nat@@ ched away from gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the director of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainers are still working freely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told rep@@ or@@ ters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mour@@ ning ceremony for soldiers ab@@ orted in Mali
at a fun@@ eral in the north @-@ northern Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers had thought of a helic@@ opter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ town under high security measures .
to the still un@@ explained fall of the fall , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( C@@ DU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two in@@ verse pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ zers from Northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week in Mali in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( C@@ DU ) and the General inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr , Volker Wi@@ eker .
gra@@ bs laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arms on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of Ley@@ en called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and s@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ at Cra@@ fts@@ man set up the flight operation of the fight helic@@ opter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not turn off the crash , no one would have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no doubt at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en did not show : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are ref@@ unded , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish kingdom is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , and she called it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - nor after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the head @-@ speaker of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French emb@@ assy on the Th@@ ames .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ wn , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his almost 50 years of reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I was doing was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ ver@@ ing , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk threads instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swi@@ ft re @-@ election
C@@ DU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority ( SPD ) , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister , Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , is not willing to res@@ ign , however , for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising res@@ ig@@ nation of a Green Party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ c@@ ely one @-@ voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the former Green Dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination of the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the C@@ DU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his group to include them .
so C@@ DU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan W@@ eil believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the C@@ DU faction is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ects the confidence of the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphas@@ ised : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follo@@ wer of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land mass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that she has received her Land@@ tag Archives , which she received via the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we can &apos;t understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the tak@@ eover of the Lower Saxony Par@@ liament@@ ary Party El@@ ke T@@ westen as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to quickly select the Land@@ tag .
the exit west@@ ward costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their van@@ ity van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration , the politicians point out their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hubertus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the C@@ DU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the C@@ DU .
the SPD leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal career memory .
the C@@ DU was at that time the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens in the parliament , but had a very thin majority in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ ison ice , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how did the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the German Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the inc@@ eption of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has the same importance as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harm@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the resi@@ dual value of 0.@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transport@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants have no immediate gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little control ure in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only a lack of staff or even legal competence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can occur are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already pointed out many times that I am expecting a complete explanation by the authorities responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and transport@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the fake means manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels it has to work consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ interrupted spending on European football clubs will not inter@@ fere with Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PSG must prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can make money loose with security so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar is signing and bringing him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich by the energy rich by Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may have a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that enable them to have the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P postpon@@ ement period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini dropped by the pres@@ idency in the year 2015 , his latest UEF@@ A successor of Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly add the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , she can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the rede@@ mption rate for the next five years in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million Euros can be reported in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might attempt to list their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not qualify as legitimate income .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA Spon@@ sor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PSG @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will become and such a man@@ oeuvre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PSG will mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG using Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke of the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest published reports show that in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros has been achieved .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PSG expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish le@@ ague was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that he would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new line supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the close cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order ane@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ man Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request from the news agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small scrap sh@@ ear@@ ed pla@@ iting panels of 14 grams per year distribute the flight att@@ endants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order in accordance with &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achiev@@ es annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
as many applicants exist in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey wants to make an effort to rene@@ w the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not re@@ achable for an opinion .
chocolate bars distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo took Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
the airline operates with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights , customers of First Class are spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
also on the short stretch , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , both in Business and Economy Class .

this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 &apos;s characters , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ ff@@ ing up on the core of the g@@ ag - actor middle ages play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - nevertheless they managed to reg@@ ain the impos@@ sibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emoti@@ onally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Hand , die die Wie@@ ge schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point , a character stum@@ bles through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot in which Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian black ) .
as always , the exc@@ esses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise like a sort of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achiev@@ es that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the bonds of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ective Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West ring competition icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ sp@@ elled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in six long episo@@ des , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who was edited on a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emb@@ assy for the imag@@ inary commun@@ istic audience is that Western culture can do everything for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police failed to beat the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 def@@ endants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already warran@@ ts arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time ra@@ ids in Italy were arrested two persons .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
altogether more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , addi@@ cted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office establishes Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosecution authorities in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Master was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian prosec@@ ut@@ ors compl@@ ained about the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account .

&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and dep@@ ortation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data register , the data is reported to ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
because the data has not been adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good .
data from 1921 have been found in individual cases , &quot; from people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer emerge in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics on descrip@@ tive people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; char@@ geable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 years of age when they entered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this proceeds from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that the BA@@ MF manages such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin treaty is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) is sufficient for these commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Bank in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights violations and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed over 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community ackno@@ wle@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous as our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available for stran@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner under@@ lined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circle of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preser@@ v@@ atives are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ circle lad@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants .
as before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Sch@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Re@@ eber@@ ry numbered the multi @-@ teams and awarded 50 blood donations each year .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter had spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have ste@@ amed spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 in keeping interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget imports would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alised that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to ch@@ ase the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of credit could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks as of the next February , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ line of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest in interest and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor increase in salary , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing gets worse first before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the fall of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the pound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates was increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be re@@ drawn in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exce@@ ed@@ ance in relation to their goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent s@@ wap install@@ ments , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages conclude , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis took place before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now delivered by the Health Service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court had confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will belong to the first who will allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection haz@@ ards .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This big new intervention should complement and over@@ h@@ aul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if specifically targeted to vulnerable and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to stop the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank into Ear@@ ls Court Apartment from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the lev@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled the Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering has gone in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square met@@ ering of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property @-@ empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute due to one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate imperi@@ alists worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S currently lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have bought 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co jeans were founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ e@@ ased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial record states that this means that Col@@ in has a value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ or@@ tions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed proceedings .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - from what Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ e@@ ased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started west there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; By the terms of their financial separation , Paul says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in rep@@ lied by text to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from news media - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course .
here is a piece by rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House he wanted to fix : bad news coming into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media di@@ ät .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship to television lasts for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump compl@@ ained about un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold the t@@ witter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ umps was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that the twe@@ ets don &apos;t contain even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know about the twe@@ ets that dump has not sent .
if his collabor@@ ators manage to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump of contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , who are composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to bring du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is trying to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when a copy of an article published by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of being &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he expressed false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a pri@@ esth@@ ood , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still asp@@ ire to influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are again with a few determined travellers on the base of the war that had negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch drawn from the commun@@ e in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they had only been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and sque@@ e@@ zed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back again .
more came to the evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my congreg@@ ations if the council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birk@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Luise
the Wald@@ hotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof , by the then Ambi@@ ence Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the city tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt , Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has long been standing in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works will be made .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the amenities .
you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , sha@@ ver empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the outer anlagen are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which is open to the restaurant which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler setzt Grand Jury ein
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee in recent weeks has taken the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper disc@@ ar@@ ded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ c@@ aster reported that there are already first inv@@ itations to the Gre@@ mi@@ dium in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully mixed up in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps &apos;s elec@@ toral campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the investigations is to stand several men who acted as a consultant to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more t@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the special mitt@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally moved to the center and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; count &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons to take part under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former chief executive Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the conversation .
legal experts told on Thursday evening on the US television that the setting shows that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary .
but it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he ignor@@ es nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but he usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was called on in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this raid , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler and its employees .
the most qu@@ il@@ ted spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be dismis@@ sed .
unlike an independent special issu@@ er of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later returned president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired upon the pres@@ idents of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators were legisl@@ ated on Thursday , according to which the special agents could no longer be dismis@@ sed so easily .
Is@@ z@@ tim@@ ér : bungalow in the Ban@@ kon@@ y @-@ Forest
in the western ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fest .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
who drove large col@@ oss@@ oms over a tril@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometers to the north and will probably need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest ic@@ ec@@ gi@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the break@@ up of the ic@@ eberg is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of c@@ ud@@ dly in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
Sch@@ el@@ ven is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this shelf life was disturbed by the balance of w@@ axes and v@@ om@@ iting several years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fest will be tra@@ pped there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under sus@@ pen@@ se and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ ven and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it float on the water and ur@@ ges ice as much water as it yields after the melt itself .
however , the loss of the closing date leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can reach the sea straight into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before .
this could possibly raise the sea level , but only in a slight extent , the British research project is writing to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is the fourth biggest shr@@ ine of Ant@@ arc@@ tica after A@@ WI data with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fest will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly mer@@ ry , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers fail to lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , in recent decades many ice @-@ eag@@ les of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long skir@@ t of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey &apos;s research programme , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28,@@ 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ ines to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
C@@ DU wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the C@@ DU demanded to leave the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the circle day has won 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
approximately 620 applications for this year were to be seen in vain .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
there are currently 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the C@@ DU wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for professionals , but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking application short@@ ages .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ new@@ com@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for C@@ DU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease @-@ related , or age @-@ related factors come out of the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the highest time for action so that there are no more places to remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , faction leader of the C@@ DU , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he had long been sor@@ row@@ ful in the circle day for a f@@ au@@ st@@ ous surprise when he publicly challenged the bill of personnel and the rest of the parties start@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not here at short notice to a satis@@ factory solution , the circle administration with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ related cities - should strive for a tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the C@@ DU tries to pay the employees and officials even better than they actually see the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to submit to detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian Prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pres@@ umed that the crew receives ding@@ h@@ y migrants aboard , delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can ab@@ ort , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the case of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives ob@@ serves .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must primarily have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( M@@ SF ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue took place in the last weeks was that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine ham@@ lets of bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ posts , &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour continued with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
there followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents for which long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , there was a v@@ antage point at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ verse hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker breath@@ ed into the open air inhal@@ atorium of cur@@ ative br@@ ine .

after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 m@@ ft@@ . the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgra@@ des itself for E @-@ Sport
in the future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , rather than swe@@ ating through the stadium racing against wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high coll@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first federal states who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning started in 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire quite new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Executive Director Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train there are still many clubs asc@@ ending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Federation hosted the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs were trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .

what is it exactly about ?
in e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA simulation FIFA will compete on competition level .
as in normal sports , they have long since established lifts in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and at the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the idea is definitely getting used to .
Ingo FRO@@ BÖ@@ SE also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that one can also find in the classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but FRO@@ BÖ@@ SE also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport lack@@ ed .
the scientist highlights the high integ@@ rative impact of e @-@ sports .
the players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years turnover is expected to be at 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
even in Europe some things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a lesson , says FRO@@ BÖ@@ SE .
in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine , according to D@@ utt , is now oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall away , and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time the company is on the cutting edge of the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot cling to that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter found guilty of the lyrics by Conrad Roy for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subject to trial .
Carter was convi@@ cted of Conrad Roy in June on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is very comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain vac@@ ant until his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ rie &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness had a significant effect on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will bear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ YS &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the recognition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed lyrics announ@@ cements that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , make yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convi@@ cted of murder at her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in 2007 , belonged to her British ro@@ omm@@ ate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ly was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm you .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua Kim@@ ber immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his loyalty to his arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; he told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first bet as a Bavaria captain .
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f who had come out of the holidays , but he .
sugar is distributed to those who want to be served much , which one wants to keep in a mood .
so those who were chosen to compete with the inheritance of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber confirmed : &quot; this is what one wants as a player : to take over responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
right back , this is now his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting line like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal therefore to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to join the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( folded also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le had no negative impact on their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
but after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ ain@@ ted sover@@ eign@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game over@@ lay , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game following the game .
for example Rud@@ y did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye after a few short statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ dle the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around is nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gaps between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au are now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes to establish a planning process , until 2021 is expected to stand up to the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Constitutional Service Plan .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Government Cornelia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier asp@@ ires , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , to the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports losing track for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the constitu@@ ent master test and 2,500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , quick facts are to be created , at the same time the country is out of place for the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far .
the Chamber of Commerce demands to award more orders to external offices .
C@@ DU @-@ FRA@@ K@@ TION@@ S@@ VI@@ ZE Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculation of the Court , the Land invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million Euros less in the maintenance of country roads than proposed .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to resolve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
in addition , the present broad@@ band expansion in the country is also more serious .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the ma@@ ins supply in an I@@ HK survey only with rating 3.4 .
they compl@@ ain about stock@@ pil@@ ing internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ econom@@ ist Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she returned to the field after four months due to discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to update in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ ite diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of the car manufacturers , systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases , ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dec@@ ei@@ ving the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indi@@ cted , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately proportional to Volkswagen &apos;s profit . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los n@@ oses and laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most frequently published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the n@@ oses of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine still draws and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures show in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he still sits on the drawing table , and works almost ten hours a day .
about Calendar , Pu@@ zzles , Books for Large and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and Wat@@ ches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a carto@@ on animation and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ phi@@ c &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ fold as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o says .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
lav@@ ender from the Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought and due to illness @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only holiday@@ makers , it is also popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the rep@@ or@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and throughout the country there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to started his office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ or@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ or@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traffi@@ cking every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are omin@@ ous and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we susp@@ ect all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ador@@ ned , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug king who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) is a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , pres@@ umed ga@@ it members bought each copy of the issue once they were ex@@ tradi@@ ted to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country on its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper published in the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the anti @-@ tox@@ in problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ or@@ ters loved to be able to publish well @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history wherever it was .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many mur@@ ders ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his spo@@ ilt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wron@@ g@@ ly , get away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ or@@ ters sur@@ vey@@ ed , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who the governor had called not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the rep@@ or@@ ters have gone into the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenditure , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost all the century ruled on all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months before , readers of Val@@ dez had looked at the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few characters and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration by another journalist at the Office of the Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
throughout the country journalists have become lou@@ der by written down in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez moved away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists to spy on journalists and to bring them around because they have said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , in which government officials and a uniform society were &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ or@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blank@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media fan group has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern bor@@ der@@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern bor@@ der@@ state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Laredo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are h@@ unted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admit that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones started to sum .
a number of sk@@ e@@ wers with band ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the edge of the board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the inter@@ ns asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid their enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , though also a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that its sk@@ ill@@ ful skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ ually arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dose @-@ Ter@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something out of the rock of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth cl@@ umps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , was probably threatened by flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ acting which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to devi@@ ate his enemies , say experts suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ gu@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs were h@@ unted by me@@ ats eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution was fav@@ oring the veil@@ ing of confront@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ stal@@ ag@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous Age , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal for cl@@ ues about his life , including his con@@ served intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank in the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dose @-@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative sk@@ ill@@ ful skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cir@@ cus period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you might think that it is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal baths , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was h@@ unted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of he@@ avi@@ est monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the perpet@@ u@@ ated arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were floo@@ ded by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater mation kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste covers still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rema@@ in@@ ders of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot sits on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A@@ 8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re @-@ long st@@ aus and g@@ aff .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured during the afternoon in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first data of the police , there were nearly 30 vehicles between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably also trucks .
there are no indications of the exact number of the injured persons .
it deals with mild to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large listing of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in driving direction Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long back@@ stab@@ au was formed .
like a AZ rep@@ orter , it also happened on the opposite way to massive handi@@ caps - by numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle clin@@ ker who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is remin@@ is@@ cent of the train and sle@@ eps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up one uns@@ an@@ gled or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
Car@@ an d &apos; A@@ che ( 101 )
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free driving card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take its seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available on many more long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Bahn spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket validation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it via the app of the rail@@ ways , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train att@@ endants receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
the train att@@ endant at the Y knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valued online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train companion , simply check in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Member of the Marketing Management Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who drive train , know that apart from delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions belong to the biggest troub@@ les .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to submit is missing .
the result is endless discussions between the train companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only based on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other ten@@ sile numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ os@@ oever Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she posted Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ ler @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly being saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live .
he posted an image of Brown colour@@ less body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to her and her fel@@ lowship .
she put her cell phone off to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , a different polic@@ eman escaped his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked about that they had countless times before that morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , she is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
one question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt passengers .
his engagement made Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and marri@@ es her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repeated the role of black women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify itself as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she feels bound to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she walked onto the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers talk about Bit @-@ Gallery
the Bit @-@ Gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves the topic hardly any one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while one can say to the Bit @-@ Galerie : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das wäre echt klasse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market for many years already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some have been for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
because after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents are often not sustainable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peasant market hall going to work during the construction ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping centre that is empty no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they public@@ ised Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website as a secret of classified diplomatic reports .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A related simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg embra@@ ced the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could be a shar@@ per , although some intellectual comments not only create the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ ie , in which p@@ anning visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers made of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette stu@@ ff@@ ers and che@@ wing g@@ um by extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA @-@ portrait .
the artist and her imprison@@ ed m@@ use were turned into un@@ equal bri@@ efs , which during the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ y@@ sees judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to request Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy meeting .
there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able routes to infl@@ ame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called with her excessive signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) to show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows M@@ anning how it appears with a hands @-@ free spy in the hand of the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they knew your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never halt your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les that flo@@ wn like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea as the movement that also stuck behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for kill@@ ings
a nation@@ wide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who were considered susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the County Court of Cook Co .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the dragon as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ the has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ unting , the Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ then had now been in ass@@ essments and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ unting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
security cameras were confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a potential domestic occurrence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ADA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the plan of the W@@ ADA to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern to Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was excluded from the W@@ ADA in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July , W@@ ADA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that Rus@@ ada moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs more
these shared the company groups .
it was a pure precau@@ tion that could further be assumed from any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lan@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ di wanted to produce clarity and transparency with his customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the start @-@ ups that will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ yp@@ ass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Gl@@ int won .
in addition to Sn@@ ap surveys and poll@@ s from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company which at a glance shows which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can bo@@ ears why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like Gl@@ int , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Committee could have a value of more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ gence , who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ sely has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
like Gl@@ int , conver@@ sely companies send custom &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect familiar answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion rep@@ hr@@ ined the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ting , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , &quot; Quin@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Conver@@ ters for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , &quot; said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company men@@ tions conver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who sat in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair tra@@ ine@@ - are identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who dire@@ cts the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to ap@@ point ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical breach through the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both gl@@ int and conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors to support both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ sely received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising in the face of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both converting and gl@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no measures .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , employees wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really belong to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about Gl@@ int is reported , so ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
Ruby Tuesday gives the company a new insight into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose your customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
at 23 o &apos;clock , there is a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have with@@ drawn their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled to the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water Man Football Center the next morning .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bro@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp for almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood hands @-@ on exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he support the Reg@@ ul@@ atory Change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken on , they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practice once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight@@ ings of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been dropped with foot@@ balls , which will have a safety net behind a pe@@ at post , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties , and then adverti@@ se their results under the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight fake news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential counter@@ f@@ eit messages and send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may display the results of the fact test from the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake News , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to get rid of the social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the understanding , which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual re@@ viewers , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test its feature to the &quot; related articles , &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ iry of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time one burned a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated my welcome greeting , &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted Hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust had received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what was said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let all go going ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al that came up in the lock in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kne@@ e Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who produced his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be a fence , getting debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men dissolved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the fu@@ cking life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the veil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes on her website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen we are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be seen as a new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine in Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians at the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air@@ strikes and the nav@@ y were depos@@ ed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which Erdo@@ gan looks as the wi@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this week has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really under control of the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ beh@@ est in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed itself in the lifting of the veil ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the grand @-@ pur@@ se in the army and the security forces is going on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan dismis@@ sed another 73@@ 95 operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly disorder .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pushing targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned a particularly not so @-@ called officer who sought asylum after the attempted put@@ sch of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not cause N@@ ato to be cold .
there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration policy to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it proposes to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by modi@@ fying the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the migration of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit board shuttle service
over the past few months over the past few months have been cont@@ ested about the future of the racing circuit - now it is supposed to be very fast .
even before the end of the year it is to be built on the mar@@ ode circuit , on which the tourist train is going to be built .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track will commen@@ ce at the end of the year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and repair the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Verkehrs@@ staat@@ s@@ secretary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of over@@ h@@ aul@@ ing the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
by this sum , the country transl@@ ates 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently finally agreed , stated S@@ ühl .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ia railway as the operator agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered regular in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g stations .
over the past few months , a pilot company has been tested as to whether the route is used by many people to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly coloured .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking your asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ atri@@ ots have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select anything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ ford woman would look progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ atri@@ s have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to their properties , which they find appealing , for example , sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the Site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturb@@ ing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive female properties , the all@@ usions to rape when one passes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ves with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point out to some dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the mar@@ ginal zones can be very instru@@ ctive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women being sex@@ ually attacked .
the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ oured body and the engra@@ ved eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realis@@ tically as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid service
t@@ umps of great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a confirmation of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized US vot@@ ers have also split families in small @-@ format .
in the USA , around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of cl@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all supp@@ os@@ edly ex@@ ert to let our fil@@ tering blow burst .
less notice has been the power of l@@ umps , bringing together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family who has visited New York this week .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with the ump in the White House every one she knows , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same page .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the setting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his girl@@ sa will no longer be thrown away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of mad@@ ness - the dog on the car &apos;s roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) - both of which occur in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild Cri@@ mes .
when Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals are twi@@ sted to watch full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ating music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city are dec@@ eived : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ics Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magic experience , since two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 19@@ 40@@ s can go on and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked them afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I went through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to pay the valuation with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to slo@@ wing down what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to a case in his cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he was holding his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national law enforcement authorities said that they will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ caps and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen have been dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 pupils of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grows in the chi@@ ck@@ yard , but then is released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler im Hüh@@ ner@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ck@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was sm@@ ashing , the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the recording of Y@@ vonne Frank a chi@@ ck@@ ly dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who bore Cy@@ lin@@ ders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ man @-@ money @-@ sler that he feels accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a by@@ word to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who is always jumping into teaching positions , and the parents representatives .
the D@@ ry period is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they only dis@@ agree with their students because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door sler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end all students ended up with a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first kl@@ aters have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprison@@ ed for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal tents were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while a study is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camping and place any one found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should improve the emission performance of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa are ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates that are dealt with are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but no exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has told everyone to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would attract , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive drop in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel so far .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ess events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the Kul@@ tu@@ schka Show announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honoured ones .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the prize @-@ winner , announced with progressive TV shows , has already announced to refra@@ in from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he is convey@@ ed in the press award .
he reports of varied but also challenging tasks that await his followers .
at the same time , it &apos;s wonder@@ ed that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
at the earliest possible time , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer .
in compliance with the regular periods of notice , there should be still enough time to prepare .
since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ civil authority , the applicant has to submit corresponding conclusions .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
would they no longer be able to fill them up , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the clos@@ eness to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have been accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are diversi@@ fied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park area have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will be@@ ech about 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
designer is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of large play@@ room .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and Gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , versatility can be flexi@@ bly responded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Old Town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the schei@@ dt Stadt@@ bau@@ meister st@@ resses .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything works over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of collabor@@ ators : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and to remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be buried in Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should have completed a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt stands for civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management , gra@@ ding facilities , administration of urban properties , Städ@@ tische Betriebs@@ shof with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei as well as lower building rights authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South @-@ track @-@ track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the pipes .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
near the scene , a rose Roll@@ er- and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lus@@ bu@@ en@@ reich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen also could come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount to go out said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south @-@ rail route could be carried out without any disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of which were concerned about the long @-@ distance transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , approximately 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide inside the food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to dis@@ solve inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments have been found that a sort of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an promotes less inflammatory bo@@ wel micro@@ lie@@ us if the same system also works with people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which was separated , did not have this .
she assumed that the difference with the gut micro@@ bi@@ om@@ es of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound cap@@ tion of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked out against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which Mour@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mour@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started off in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when Mour@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this week the Independent revealed that Mour@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , for that I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they receive four of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire @-@ fire from the party centre , but no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation - this was the most important wish of the elec@@ toral fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ dominated provincial capitals .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep beats .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot simply go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ DU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising lesson from a Green Party member has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the parliamentary elections its red @-@ green coalition therefore lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed El@@ ke T@@ westen in Lower Saxony to give back her mandate .
the transition to the C@@ DU means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the will@@ power .
El@@ ke T@@ westen needs to res@@ ign her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Office and elec@@ toral campaign manager of the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sigh@@ s an SPD campaign , when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is facing the C@@ DU without its own government majority following the passing of the green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the pro@@ visional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD constitu@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the Mis@@ sing began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more than not , re@@ assured the comrades at the time .
after the regional elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was also done - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ te the party sli@@ pper@@ y .
the comrades in the weeks after that were lab@@ orious again .
then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next grav@@ ure came .
mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD LAN@@ DE@@ SCH@@ EF , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because in crisis communication , everything went wrong after that , what you can do wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then Scholz is fighting for its political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
because of the VW @-@ f@@ ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the super@@ visory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , W@@ eil tried to put emphasis on acc@@ ents in the federal government .
the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by W@@ eil .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , W@@ eil makes no fault with the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the back@@ sliding parliament@@ ar@@ ism in the v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen puts her own career choices about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Dutch MP continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeuvre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tor@@ ate wil@@ le four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the German SPD as a candidate into the German Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future C@@ DU @-@ Euro MPs fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments made by the C@@ DU Niedersachsen .
Förder@@ gel@@ der für Orts@@ kern III
those who want to be renovated in the years can soon get support from the country .
furthermore , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of STE@@ G Stadt@@ entwicklung on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 it has been in sensitive remedi@@ ation areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding sum .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the District Court of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the sum total of 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 euros came from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ bilities .
how is a refurb@@ ishment area now created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , so Sch@@ in@@ dler further investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether interest exists in the planned territory .
if necessary , the area borders could also shift again .
the STE@@ G represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal @-@ country programme in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be done obj@@ ectively , that is , per plot .
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be defined as a by@@ laws .
the payment period for funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , as part of those participating in the rehabilitation area received a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December it should take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that any municipality had to carry out the pre @-@ examinations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about evaluating the urban development gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come to the sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which deals with the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation steps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hous@@ ehold and Housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes , first grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Orts@@ kern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisor to the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising cost of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data left to TIME Magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helic@@ opter , which was manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited in addition to a Yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine helic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helic@@ opter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his super@@ visor , the deputy Navy Commander for Avi@@ ation .
the news showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on July 17 at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the tur@@ f was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helic@@ opter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the records made available from the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers using American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helic@@ opter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting helic@@ op@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D ref@@ und@@ table for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24,@@ 380 USD per flying lesson .
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; especially the imports from the high North are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Fin@@ ns can even refer to inser@@ ts in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he set up his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ force the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels pushed against the U.S. advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the proposal seems to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors are worried about the domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Project Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should even raise the sanctions via Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are his choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staffel 3 Trailer : ohne Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar das Cal@@ i Cart@@ el wird in der Hit@@ reihe von Net@@ fli@@ x is placed in the center
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer un@@ covers , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest news of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A raised its attention to the world &apos;s rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; with more state bur@@ dens and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban centers the clock is turned back .
on the 1st of September , Kre@@ feld took over the food supply at the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bo@@ iled will continue except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh Gek@@ o@@ chtes cooled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 kinder@@ garten facilities , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last year Kit@@ aj@@ ahr always sat at the tables of 28@@ 00 , and the need is steadily growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 weekly hours are in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service if children stay at 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give off , rin@@ se , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has found in cost comparison between self @-@ government and foreign awar@@ ding to the city as the most economical one , it is called the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ positioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will go to the provinces in the coun@@ cils . three women candidates for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democra@@ tically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers are registered .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow for the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies produces .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; to express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be advanced . &quot;
G@@ MB senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow des@@ per@@ ately needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ all@@ eiter at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it since we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;

the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ .000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced out his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but three years ago , the football world was warned of the PSG @-@ President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign up one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG @-@ Mittel@@ feld player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .
roller revers@@ ed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown off@@ ender has deliberately turned off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 , and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s property damage of more than 200 euros .
the police station Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice .
to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police search for witnesses .
because a car came in front of him , the driver had to depart from a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ch@@ ised the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um went on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the city envel@@ ope of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ch@@ anted the crash barrier .
there was no damage on passenger cars .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the author &apos;s experience to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication to the German press agency , he acquired the former German bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their incorrect evaluation of the events at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the press coverage of violence in the case of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ ab@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and that &apos;s a bon@@ y fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes have been a very normal educational mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often di@@ ved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who with R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder der Papst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 pages report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clari@@ fication solic@@ ited attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 , is said : &quot; in summary , it is possible that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases .
especially for high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims of R. appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even associate positive memories with him in many cases despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence of violence against the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ ctory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible when a domain voc@@ alist did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
it has just been devoted to eight pages , and it is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ use of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of its sphere of action .
it is possible to blame him at all , knowing it too late or having taken first hints not serious enough .
the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he was working was felt by practically all the respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very good testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and was &quot; always enc@@ amp@@ unk of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to bur@@ gl@@ ars .
that he did not only kno@@ ck with chairs and threw the key on the floor , but also distributed ear fig@@ s and too che@@ ek@@ ed guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given up years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , as well as with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ ad@@ ful .
one wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fallen upon him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media in connection with the report a lot has been reported about the topic of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also accused of any involvement or sympathy with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults asser@@ ts to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an aff@@ licted representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they weren &apos;t even entrusted to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have opened more urg@@ ently or more clearly or more clearly than to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , confidence teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any share .
in this way he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to contact his good name with these contradi@@ ctory crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disc@@ ern@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
in fact , clean@@ ly separated : between the primary school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ cats .
all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were arbit@@ rar@@ ily schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic and mal@@ icious , suffered all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where there was really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boy &apos;s face when they were already on the cathedral &apos;s gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that was how most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the blame remains to have been taken away .
but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself , and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger make his ears consistently in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press announ@@ cements , he recommended urgent steps .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was to be banned in Bavaria too .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he would have looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the testing sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria also in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of evaluating past past moral standards .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was bre@@ ached in the primary school of ad@@ vers@@ aries and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am happy that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so ear fig@@ s and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger repeated in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder der Papst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing punishment also the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t really hide that he carried a strict reg@@ iment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would have hardly been possible for him to form an institution of world rank , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys , one does not even make any great singers and before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ exagger@@ ation .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply faithful and hear@@ ty people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , keep in touch with him , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect to respect , to which they still look up today and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , once again clearly , everything that one prepar@@ es for him are educational methods that were at that time on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , that is all too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the An@@ te would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gotten himself great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
