<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-farmers cultivate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card game promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows, who had to be exciting because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a circumference road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria of State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated into cities and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originates from Bavaria's first survey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt für München dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is an example of this, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the west park is, one sees nothing as a field - at first sight: in the zooming a small-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered floodgates from the so-called "primitive" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers today - but small gardeners of the facility" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen site, one reads not only the street names" "" "am Gasteig" "" "or from the height of" "" "Auf der Lüfte" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße you were once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich District-IrrenRentenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüfte" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gyro-sirens in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II by bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies seized many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promoting farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28, 2017 demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, racist-based incidents occur lately throughout the state and can be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as prosecuting authorities of the state that disproportionately targets minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist transgressions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken seriously by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015 Missouri signed 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI Hassverbrechens's report, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company for employment or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states passed immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violation, which will contribute to further racial profiling in the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman's Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the district court of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann provided insight into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses the Feriengäste in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "black" "" "milk" "" "is for him the alternative distribution path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionales exclusively come to the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt as" "" "spontaneous" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot generate profitable on such a steep area." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green areas ensure a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the forestation of the land could be extended for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often criticised for funding." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface is 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of approximately 71 500 Euros, half was promoted via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac emphasized:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and aggravates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm," "" "Here are the best foods produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landschaftspflegerichtsie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the enumerable area must not be minced (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 parking cells, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence for the Fish erbacher project, is currently under construction.</seg>
<seg id="96">The coverage area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have vowed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took hold of their importance, and in particular the importance of which you were attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta implied, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to, which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the shaking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your mills, your arms, and your oppressed masses, who desire to breathe free, / the miserable fall of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable fall" "" "was better on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism, representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical picture.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatism that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, eleventful, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not lighten the path, but ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius-Kirche</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first documented in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg mit der Pfarrkirche zu Tumlingen together with the Vogtei "an Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the hill hill, apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard that belonged to the church or patronage law and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the underground village and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the most glorified settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the Early Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In this way, the right to use a priest or to propose a new minister to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two barred at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were infiltrated and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were located near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius graveyard served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night, in 1834, a storm split the tower and the half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken down.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg still existing today remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "creative pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite the friends and sponsors to Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is arranged by the combo des Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Director Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To end the serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius site, which is of importance for tumors and hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoter Tumlingens are particularly committed to their home care, such as Serenade-Organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone exists at the time in Viersen.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent a" "" "recess" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>

<seg id="520">NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette for the construction of four wind turbines, each 200 meters high.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen participates in cash, had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare property.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="663">In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf focuses on a colorful-frivolous staging from gigantic, six-story coulisse.</seg>
<seg id="664">The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with a masonry and dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="665">Before that, an open Mercedes classic car, in which the Rheintöchter posed as a rock-irls, or alternatively a Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="666">Stacked oil drums reminiscent of Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which moves through his "ring" stage.</seg>
<seg id="667">The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as already in the "Rheingold" wonderfully.</seg>

<seg id="674">There is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.</seg>
<seg id="675">The performance of Frank Castorf and his regional team had been anticipated with suspense.</seg>

<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school in the open whole day.</seg>

<seg id="711">Whether a refugee whether a young man has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>

<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge, a bridge cap of 2,20 meters is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing uninterrupted spending on European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars Weltrekord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG must prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 million ($262 million) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with security so that Neymar is signing and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich by the energy rich by Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"" "" "" "clubs may have a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that enable them to have the break-even point in their business-related business." ""</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP postponement period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini dropped by the presidency in the year 2015, his latest UEFA successor of Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly add the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, she can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption rate for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million Euros can be reported in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might attempt to list their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan enterprise could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not qualify as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA Sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG-payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will become and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG will mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG using Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke of the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank into Earls Court Apartment from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the levy.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering has gone in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is mutual, so when you push the door, it is very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property will be appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which can help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from news media - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to fix: bad news coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diät.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television lasts for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when Trump complained about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to hold the twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that" "" "under control" "" "tumps was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that the tweets don't contain even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about the tweets that dump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators manage to keep annoyance from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump of controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, who are composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to bring dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is trying to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when a copy of an article published by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of being" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for scaffolding or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he expressed false accusations and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a priesthood, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still aspire to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the special mittler Trump personally moved to the center and investigate whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of affairs." ""</seg>

<seg id="1498">Legal experts told on Thursday evening on the US television that the setting shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the Gremidium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray Russia's affairs as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this raid, accusations against Trump have been noisy, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Sonderermittler and its employees.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Isztimér: bungalow in the Bankony-Forest</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Schelfest.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">Who drove large colossoms over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometers to the north and will probably need two, three years until he was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the biggest icecgiants who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakup of the iceberg is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of cuddly in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colon was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelven is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shelf life was disturbed by the balance of waxes and vomiting several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfest will be trapped there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelven is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under suspense and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelven and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as it float on the water and urges ice as much water as it yields after the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the closing date leads to the fact that the glaciers can reach the sea straight into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise the sea level, but only in a slight extent, the British research project is writing to observe the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelven is the fourth biggest shrine of Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelfest will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly merry, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers fail to lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, in recent decades many ice-eagles of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey's research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tines to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-newcomers and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>

<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to submit to detailed allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is definitely getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo FROBÖSE also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that one can also find in the classical sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most frequently published cartoon draftsmen, the noses of his figures are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Even with 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he presented himself as a drawer for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to illness-borne insects, which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing large headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change over the past few years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits Zwergzikaden, and in very dry weather there are very many of it. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have developed smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and throughout the country there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto started his office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Feodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are ominous and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefits," "" "says Ibarra." ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we suspect all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of adorned, two-storey mausoleums for drug king who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60) is a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gait members bought each copy of the issue once they were extradited to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country on its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper published in the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the anti-toxin problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish well-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodosia, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ distinction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many murders... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine his spoilt?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret" "" "runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrongly, get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters surveyed, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who the governor had called not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has printed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditure, which concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost all the century ruled on all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs were hunted by meats eating dinosaurs that evolution was favoring the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this Nostalagrier was subjected to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the Cretaceous Age," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about his life, including his conserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank in the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodose-rier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative skillful skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early circus period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you might think that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermal baths, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heaviest monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the perpetuated armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured herbivores were flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater mation kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste covers still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remainders of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot sits on his side, his five fingers are stretched upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometre-long staus and gaff.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured during the afternoon in a mass-carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, there were nearly 30 vehicles between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, among them probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of the injured persons.</seg>

<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it via the app of the railways, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>

<seg id="2006">The train attendant at the Y knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So one can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>

<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train companion and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the Schaffner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed, where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked about that they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived at Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement made Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be an end.</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year prison sentence after they publicised WikiLeaks's website as a secret of classified diplomatic reports.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A related similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg embraced the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could be a sharper, although some intellectual comments not only create the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-ie, in which panning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this the artist produced portraits of strangers made of forensic artifacts like cigarette stuffers and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA-portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were turned into unequal briefs, which during the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future in which the President Chelysees judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to request Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable routes to inflame the rigid circuits that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her excessive signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) to show how astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who were considered suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the County Court of Cook Co.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is on waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to Snap surveys and polls from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company which at a glance shows which units have the most discomfort and which managers have low consents results - so that you can boears why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Committee could have a value of more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convergence, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>

<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, conversely companies send custom "pulse" surveys, collect familiar answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion rephrined the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Converent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotting, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, "Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Converters for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, "said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company mentions convercent, problems that were previously hidden by managers who sat in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair traine- are identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders against employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to appoint ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical breach through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both glint and convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors to support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Conversely received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising in the face of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both converting and glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company take no measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much relied on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow, employees wonder," "" "Do you really belong to me?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about Glint is reported, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Ruby Tuesday gives the company a new insight into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even crazier in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking your ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpatriots have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select anything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that a stepford woman would look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpatris have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to their properties, which they find appealing, for example, shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "enthuses the Site of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the allusions to rape when one passes a step on Frigid (i.e.: resisting) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy behaves with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it is said on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point out to some darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the marginal zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women being sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devoured body and the engraved eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Tumps of great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a confirmation of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized US voters have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the USA, around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of clump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposedly exert to let our filtering blow burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice has been the power of lumps, bringing together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family who has visited New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With the ump in the White House every one she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is in a wider context that this also entails significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the setting effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and" "" "gump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his girlsa will no longer be thrown away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans the right wing, "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of madness - the dog on the car's roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like) - both of which occur in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild Crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump walks, the next candidate of the republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals are twisted to watch full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perating music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city are deceived: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Topics Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, since two two-year old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 1940s can go on and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I went through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to pay the valuation with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to slowing down what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>

<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he was holding his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the national law enforcement authorities said that they will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim can be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide inside the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to dissolve inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a sort of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet that is rich in tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel microlieus if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which was separated, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She assumed that the difference with the gut microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleansed from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement, "We are Church," stated after publication to the German press agency, he acquired the former German bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>

<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarabia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often dived.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who with Ratzinger wrote the book" "" "Mein Bruder der Papst" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440 pages report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification solicited attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (547 Regensburger Domspatzen) were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994, is said: "in summary, it is possible that Domkapellmeister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially for high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims of R. appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even associate positive memories with him in many cases despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became more tangible when a domain vocalist did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It has just been devoted to eight pages, and it is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excuse of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at all, knowing it too late or having taken first hints not serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The cathedral gymnasium on which he was working was felt by practically all the respondents as - literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, a very good testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and was "always encampunk of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to burglars.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only knock with chairs and threw the key on the floor, but also distributed ear figs and too cheeked guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given up years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, as well as with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, they are admittedly dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media in connection with the report a lot has been reported about the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also accused of any involvement or sympathy with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults asserts to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an afflicted representative for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they weren't even entrusted to parents and siblings, not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buben have opened more urgently or more clearly or more clearly than to their parents, dormitories, confidence teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any share.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to contact his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "Violence of Violence" "" "was to be read by the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "" "discerning" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">In fact, cleanly separated: between the primary school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were arbitrarily schizophrenic and malicious, suffered all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there was really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boy's face when they were already on the cathedral's gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was how most witnesses emphasize, the subject of "primary school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the blame remains to have been taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself, and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger make his ears consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press announcements, he recommended urgent steps.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was to be banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria also in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," thus the danger of evaluating past past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorred at all times, and not for what was breached in the primary school of adversaries and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am happy that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so ear figs and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>

<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing punishment also the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, that the cathedral-cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't really hide that he carried a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would have hardly been possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, from rebellious boys, one does not even make any great singers and before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply faithful and hearty people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, keep in touch with him, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect to respect, to which they still look up today and which they almost venerate.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly, everything that one prepares for him are educational methods that were at that time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, that is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Ante would command a 93-year-old man who has gotten himself great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
