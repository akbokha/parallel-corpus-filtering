Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in dra@@ wers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in dra@@ wers or glu@@ ed from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with loose food and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question according to the desire of the child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film will be on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger asked some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations , they ch@@ ased back home to the for@@ age in the fast g@@ allo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament vict@@ ories - again near horses .
he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
for a long time the first time in Aachen and with it also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports hall was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala .
there are no awards for the like@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete .
( Deutsch ) Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ beer@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long is the 18th pri@@ ze@@ winner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,@@ 000 Euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US champion winner was included on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
the excer@@ pts include athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmitt , the gymn@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmitt , the Ru@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping stallion Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports leaders came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are uncertain about tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical differences .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and war@@ ns about how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax@@ ing the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely decline regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , it says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost the same .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , there could be still party discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to cancel .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go down , then he says he should not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is tr@@ ump that wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics stop him , so the budget deficit would only increase .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any fled wife has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost daily .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope carrier &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary acts , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , er@@ re , relates B@@ ahr .
also here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and mis@@ used in the worst case .
this results in about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply to no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone escaped women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are several floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or become men and women together , it can lead to - perpet@@ u@@ ating - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how very the women feel this protection need can be read at the rush to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been saying that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike : demands for new employment programmes &quot; &quot; &quot;
dep@@ u@@ ties of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more labour action from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC stated that there were ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to address the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet , &quot; which led to the treaty being rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today formally applied a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that Assi@@ z@@ atri@@ sts argue six times this year , the first general out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of B@@ MA Assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 Assistant doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for physicians in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure ending a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ iling and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had happened .
I seemed to suggest his enthusiasm rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introdu@@ ctory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border crossing Turkey .
heroes of Ple@@ ven Com@@ memor@@ ated in Moscow W@@ re@@ ath@@ es from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Bulgarian Embassy were laid at the pedi@@ ment of the memorial church .
Putin ex@@ al@@ ted and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the ve@@ w becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited personally from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has veh@@ em@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after receiving almost his ministry at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat within the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late @-@ night rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television pre@@ dic@@ ated cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West because of its response to the tried and tested power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
for this purpose , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment of the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian leader of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , he called for support for the elected government organs .
for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public aton@@ ement , there are still big differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ asters , when NATO member Turkey flo@@ wed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least talk to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Executive Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer @-@ brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchanges to Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail selling more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now more on a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer be continued by the Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

on Friday Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ cks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot;

L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ es@@ ie@@ ge
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only few before him reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic force to de@@ fy his twi@@ sts and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin war@@ ns Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s close confidence for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo has ordered his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the protocol and staff head of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ red as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated item - one could almost say - entr@@ en@@ ched posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ cher@@ heits@@ dienst ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching ally of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 year old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and have put my heart in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28th September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ al , which were sp@@ ik@@ ed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ t rop@@ es .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an art of engineering by a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total deck ceiling is in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot of the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last block of road and its connection with the north tower in the extension , we had to close the existing gap on the north or shore side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6@@ .000 tons and had to be pulled upwards of approx . 3 % .
tri@@ cky because the toler@@ ances that the team worked out were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sho@@ cked on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat moving close by itself and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left the water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have un@@ har@@ med and yet to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor had an emergency stop , but this was loos@@ ened by the person who was steering the boat .
someone has w@@ ax@@ ed over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ s his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal belong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic bar@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice on her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured on the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sho@@ ok his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should in future be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; says SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must in future show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the major point in the town hall is , says Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction utility , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incen@@ tives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder issues for investors .
not@@ with@@ standing , as Brat@@ man , there is a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
but the program is not entirely up to date : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do we compens@@ ate for the loss of further around 1300 affordable housing , whose promotion will run out over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , as the bud@@ get@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be contempl@@ ated in order to get flats back to the price .
this is possible in the west city .
at one stroke the problem can be solved .
for in the west city run for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price @-@ binding for affordable apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dras@@ tically , one remo@@ ves from the aim of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the C@@ DU must go with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( later , a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped slightly in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once found &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the 35@@ .000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ ced people who exercise 30 minutes each day , rose from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get out of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages are bor@@ ed to health and come from people who look charming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ric game spo@@ ils that always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what is it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and the use will dimin@@ ish with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climb@@ ed the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Schwe@@ be@@ sto@@ ken during the solo @-@ campaign event of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who wins a title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts her in the same le@@ ague as Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport in the last three years , 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals , including a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected her last trial in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after winning Gold and Silver in the solo @-@ tournament halls of the Women in the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es got the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of the team @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an excl@@ am@@ ation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competitive competition , a winning series that will last for so long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Sweden and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title title - lau@@ ded .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently as she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ wed on fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze figure in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil exercise she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ eim@@ on to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as it is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped talking and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked during a trip , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then flew with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ due , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was temp@@ ted by the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks in nine attacks and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that susp@@ ect has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings that were depos@@ ited on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of its contemp@@ or@@ aries Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knows nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not let myself go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a walker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ wl until his third birthday and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycle cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought out for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ic has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect anybody to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ds cause b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana compelled the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected throughout the whole Saturday with more rain falls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that only the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service left alone that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain .
in the south of Alab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continues to be ra@@ ining in the area of mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stream @-@ down floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these floo@@ ded rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest point ever recorded on Friday at 09@@ .00 .
rescue teams still get people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , rose heavily overnight .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water po@@ urs and po@@ urs in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that the hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spreading rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly weigh@@ ed by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that were fl@@ ushed by the floo@@ ds .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding water and sand bags were provided for the residents to take care , which hope to keep the water out of their homes and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but there were no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; destroyed by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police inform@@ s that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lum@@ ber , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through much , his little body was en@@ rich of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cert@@ ained whether there could be one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge seals for storm ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this was clearly an ongoing fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the way , were r@@ ins@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police esc@@ ort Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the Sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest warran@@ t and the police are currently monitoring the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police search for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ bia in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls from other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ess is and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ licon , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America rejo@@ iced .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion@@ ships of Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were expecting unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ins .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans who won gold at an individual event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all struck the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . it is also the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come first and foremost in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , planning , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and their families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the communities out of countless young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach training .
I founded my gymn@@ astic foundation of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth up @-@ to @-@ date gymn@@ as@@ tics which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ time benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des olymp@@ ischen Mann@@ schafts@@ gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ .000 resident doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
in July H@@ unt plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that N@@ HS would be in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be harmful to employees and patients .
the first denti@@ sts will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance at un@@ even times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Com@@ mit@@ ee for Assistant Do@@ ctors , shared the last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assistant doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and h@@ um it to meet all the doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talking with the government on opposition are to take part and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened in a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt just last month that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to raise awareness and address the wor@@ ries of the resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out more labour @-@ action campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting physicians on the stri@@ k@@ po@@ ste chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better weekly payment for the 54@@ .000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS staff , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working conditions do not achieve anything but little , but already burden over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and dis@@ rup@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the resident doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training period , training boxes , mutual recognition of the curriculum , education holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication which can lower heart rate risk
thousands of heart inf@@ ar@@ ct patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug once advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ irrit@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the NI@@ CE regulation authority of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE regulation authority of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that make floor@@ ings .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots loose , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , established by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the name of Bri@@ anne , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft bill of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in , Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a pro@@ visional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes election fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread suff@@ rage in Muslim congreg@@ ations kno@@ w@@ ingly ignor@@ antly as a non @-@ destructive government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of elec@@ toral mis@@ use because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off belts outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable inks to a person &apos;s finger when they submit their votes to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves for election fraud , but also to protect the local government against the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting Mayor Lut@@ ad Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation in which one person as someone else cho@@ oses .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he expressed himself alarm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election ballo@@ t - in which the elderly members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding out to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was applied , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ an backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on account of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report written by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigrants and social fraud .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition , that political activists edit full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ op@@ es of sel@@ ections .
the police give the authority to set off barriers to elec@@ toral stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation as per the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
photographic prohibition in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally en@@ force that vot@@ ers alone enter the elec@@ tive cabin themselves .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court appointed Lut@@ r Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ boxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ toral regi@@ strations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have entered this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pauline Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , which proved to be an impressive twin @-@ go@@ it@@ ress of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ l@@ ete that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the race track , many people on the internet point out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star sc@@ ary similarly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard of his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great res@@ emb@@ lance with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes should go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one ais@@ le higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly serious eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swimming in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about others having noticed the simil@@ arities
theory is put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter User@@ in told her satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who shows her own wonderful , broad smile that resem@@ bles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m Fri@@ ed enth@@ r@@ alled audience of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; like &quot; dropped off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m swi@@ vel chair .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the conclusion , Baby . &quot;
too excited , as he called , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese Schwi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 57.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not got it that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the end , Baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking to him
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah &apos;s Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like raci@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly after Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formula , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times for the people who responded to the reports on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used himself in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s s@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who has sham@@ el@@ essly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers did not know where to see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a mark to try out sau@@ c@@ ots .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back to the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own stock@@ pil@@ es and pants and tried her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sau@@ c@@ ers before she finally decided that she had nothing to fall back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to be bo@@ ther@@ ed by anyone observing - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy those who had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think someone would take home with someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him somewhat safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or behind , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when approaching from behind , you should turn out to be first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with your knee and twist , while the att@@ acker sticks together in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move back@@ wards as they turn the gun on him .
when approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the gun from its grip before moving back@@ wards and the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that when a smo@@ ker is the saf@@ est to over@@ pass your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right det@@ ects his tongue for a travel guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ ws in a serious test - by raising some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cut off his course on a Euro leg , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system .
before the do@@ cking of each object he used a lumin@@ ance to show up and to show us what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med up under the title of &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought of le@@ vel@@ ing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he was able to see , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his Dar@@ ms by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task placed its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to live up to his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his dent@@ ure showed a lumin@@ ous figure of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick himself after her lumin@@ ous figure was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company will equi@@ p Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had caught some of the things I told him , just like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
aso@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an aso@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ mop@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ ck@@ ered employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were sm@@ elling holes on , wood panels were torn , gar@@ bage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall housing , said that she fears that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this estate is thought to be considered not as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted with street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and floo@@ ds included .
Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was placed on the lease , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden pl@@ anks were ri@@ pped
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and called on the police on a regular basis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to that !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall housing , said it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the church , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant would ab@@ ort all responsibility for their behaviour and their family since del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the Devon and Corn@@ wall Police as well as members of the community that have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fitz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away gar@@ bage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after she found herself guilty of the owner of a class B Dro@@ ge in Handels@@ ab@@ sicht .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal placed in panic after a ti@@ fying military jet flies
sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an unbelievable storm
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety haz@@ ard was present
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ fying jet r@@ ushes down a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal almost within reach .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped when they started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew over twice , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ yes added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic when the plane came out of the dark and incredibly low flew .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the surface , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deeply as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and br@@ anding - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first time in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans kick off the Spanish Super@@ cup in the Du@@ el towards the FC Sevilla , the return game takes three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ winner must ab@@ stain from other on Ne@@ ym@@ ar in the power of forces with the sub @-@ registered Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europa League Champion among others competing in Brazil as the Olympic football tournament .
in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the request at Bar@@ ca was at least pre @-@ clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique has so far failed to make a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the competitions .
before the first mandatory match of the new season there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the start @-@ stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after leng@@ th@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes of the record winner Barcelona , Barcelona is the winner of this competition .

Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this the world ranking first took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ z@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the titles one among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last no @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and with time outs they had no coaches .
they had with@@ drawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches so far for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang folded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , Gold@@ - and Silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang on a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball@@ ads to be seen .
Miz@@ z@@ ani won the Bronze Med@@ al against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .

Donald Tr@@ ump räum@@ t ″ tremendous troub@@ les ″ in election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , including its majority in traditional conservative states .
Donald Tr@@ ump presidential candidate has now seen weakness of his campaign in the current Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire spoke as much as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp , doubts start to grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he once again took up his famous media f@@ ist .
rep@@ airing repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds
Ut@@ ah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his conc@@ ise from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , were in@@ consistent .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for repub@@ lican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answers the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either be successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s ok , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to strike money to support his campaign , he should not be able to present better surveys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the re@@ public@@ ans of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to get more under their arms for Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the I@@ OC aims to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud trial in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee informed immediately to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the former spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IA@@ AF World Federation has searched the I@@ OC for information on the case to establish their own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to dop@@ ing control station and gave himself up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , handed down and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about forthcoming dop@@ ing tests against money @-@ making sport@@ s@@ men of his country .
according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has long been under special observation at I@@ OC after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ s .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the I@@ OC in front of the Rio Games , unusual athletes from Kenya and Russia were noted earlier .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country in front of the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
subsequently , W@@ ADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ form with the W@@ ADA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , alle@@ g@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds in Kenya are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed in Russian Athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ art area @-@ wide and systematically deb@@ ated .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Meister@@ werk .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth &apos;s dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Maria .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !

it is wise , of course nai@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .

Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life !
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !

London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS died according to reports in Syria .
the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family had passed , leaving the war @-@ torn country and returning to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with being in a war zone - people think of ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the East of London went to an air@@ plane in direction to Turkey and then embar@@ ked on a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas &apos;s family was told that she married an I@@ SIS fighter in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in case of election victory
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority shareholder in Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next President will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ e@@ ased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain level of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Rei@@ d later said that he was not yet talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge of the US Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community calcul@@ ates with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan rests on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog und Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it might even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the pres@@ idency Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard prec@@ ession of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdoğan , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is waiting for a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , mid @-@ term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already covered Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start new in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan wishes to increase the shift back to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ min@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also C@@ DU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef demanded that the federal government positions itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan rests on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Tur@@ ks already presented the largest group of asylum partners recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
as of June 30 , this 11,@@ 386 people and almost 29 per cent of all were eligible for asylum ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there are no wages that are paid before war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum enti@@ t@@ lement according to the Basic Law is exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 is not going to take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already voted in the beginning of the year .
for more stup@@ idity than so far does it not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day competition - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced of the elec@@ toral fighters , are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not nati@@ ves , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate at the end of the vote , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign short of the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / C@@ DU coalition , must be worried about his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in question clearly behind the C@@ DU .
exciting is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ stau@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large posters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through the countryside , spread Roses and chat a little with the people , just as he did his legendary voc@@ alist Harald Ring@@ storff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives the blame on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which now pres@@ um@@ ably will cost him the beautiful post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU with its nick@@ name , the Minister of Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel for major documents ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the C@@ DU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a p@@ ity not to anybody from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ C@@ DU disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that you are br@@ ushing the base on the country that it needs to be very severe to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the C@@ DU election fighter Kok@@ ert on his co @-@ worker is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wedding , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner C@@ DU ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly gained 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the C@@ DU ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , will probably create the leap into the parliament .
they make a modern virtu@@ es out of the vacation @-@ need and place their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green choice champ@@ ions go for a search for native Irish vot@@ ers among holiday@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ts straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end at about 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise .
&quot; they have done everything pretty me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Tankstelle .
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be rel@@ oc@@ ated to the south at the start of the weekend at half @-@ time until the end of October everything should be finished .
the fee also applies to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to furnish@@ ing behavi@@ our@@ al drives .
since the building site was moved south on Monday and also the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg was again made , the traffic situation within the place was relaxed .
the citizens can now leave the B 27 on both sides from Of@@ ter@@ dingen .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve way through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ alter@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality also called for a further strengthening of the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the location himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute sl@@ ot@@ ted .
the fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has gone further , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to sales break@@ through@@ s for them , each one asks them to look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are thus produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also states that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the imp@@ eller is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily explo@@ ded are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues are based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refurb@@ ishment took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his co @-@ workers have to be dischar@@ ged .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have responded differently .
instead , President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial balance with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it also has to bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where something has been handled more gener@@ ously .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are seeing less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else nice .
that its stem cells return to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clients for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are scre@@ wed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior of Mai@@ zi@@ ère now faces a big security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are overwhel@@ med by no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also , I take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority in order to take care of the un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU direc@@ tives for passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to pun@@ ish supporters for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ DU man sp@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in the case of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ eer has no chances anyway .
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans to plan swi@@ ft@@ works for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from dep@@ ortation .
refugees that are targeted specifically to the country are intended to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that people deeply occupied were not compl@@ aining about in election times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal security has moved enorm@@ ously into the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral competitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days there was a great deal between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a contro@@ vers@@ y over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka b@@ anning and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also bl@@ oss@@ oms here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return from the double @-@ pass , he holds nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things in it , which could cause conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the issue of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes discussion and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor does Volkswagen get off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the number of extra@@ dition is increasing worldwide .
but not all markets are running around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recall action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is whir@@ l around a term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with the deliveries .
in the course of the year , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to demonstrate a plus in spite of diesel prices thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core @-@ brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
market sales by Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann took the weaker figures of July mainly due to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there have been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted put@@ sch in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
group sales ef Fred Kap@@ pler benefited from a sales split from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered more than 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been t@@ amper@@ ed with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to convert into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car branch establishes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now weighing its German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed last Monday &apos;s VW representative in the ministry of transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW was able to fulfil the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA full range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all the relevant vehicle values have remained intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , a half year after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop for half a year after conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich sectors in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking and daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal sa@@ vers would not have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they have to pay their 0.4 per cent pen@@ al rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee requires the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September by Privat@@ - and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the future in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put 4000 euros for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs now pass further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; letting the cash just lie in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically lasting not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian folk and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their skat@@ eboard shop in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking Federation , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay full fee for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a bank@@ ers said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a bit more luxuri@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks und Raiff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged men love panels .
before you hur@@ ry to the comment section , to sow it under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ s@@ men middle age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the manifold re@@ formation of sound plates is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho , a humble grey suit and li@@ tig@@ ate wild before I stop , hold my hands and define something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s is gradually losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from S@@ ister Ray ( number of records : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of records : eight men middle aged , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him at home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a si@@ ze@@ able number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and will be promp@@ ted to buy their old records .
from the conversations I conducted , people usually get rid of their collection by either 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a soo@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took advantage of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that wake up happy youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the case with me as a collector so I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I f@@ ade through a pile of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Data : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tro@@ ph@@ ä@@ en@@ asp@@ ekt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only get started slowly .
opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ er pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ ma is hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window bum@@ ble@@ bee than a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the impression to patterns the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as records .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are un@@ considered , at least in plate shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and record companies that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with safety , not by ram@@ bling through the record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through records , while keeping the stub@@ born gaze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er who raises no middle aged men &apos;s shoulders .
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ ra@@ e - vide@@ ography
scientific say that Greenland has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius Niel@@ sen , who studied shar@@ ks , says that the record lay with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of businesses in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional business in which persons within the camp goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which har@@ bours a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running the 72 pro@@ visional stores , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp that is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxiliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic dis@@ appointment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : Martin stays milit@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the olymp@@ ic passage , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to be entert@@ ained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in sight , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything exactly what we have changed over the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic champion Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to be effectively transferred to the Temp@@ os@@ ün@@ der .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident statistics , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ ces , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary wind for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded at the same time using laser measurement technology .
variable speed limits as well as direction b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
in high @-@ driving conditions , it is possible to move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply sto@@ wed , it is lo@@ wered in the measurement operation , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also van@@ ish outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the se@@ ater from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently France has ordered a hundred units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain reco@@ vers Silver in 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ s rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday night at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten at a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro grade here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ha@@ sten@@ ed a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , back@@ wards , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for Britain - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , they lost every game among the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and let the attacks j@@ umped out of fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ os@@ au over@@ h@@ ech@@ ed in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
a ra@@ ging T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion carried a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB was still learning .
this is how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt for UK , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game has been running for a long time in favour of the South Sea Or@@ ders , whose fans s@@ add@@ led and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle so@@ unded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked down cr@@ ushing in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown put the bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ otic gold than in those games and that wants to be called .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the response of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they followed the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ 4 un@@ beaten work , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sp@@ ong@@ es , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make the difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was a lifting trainer than the trainer who did not know before 30 months if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortunate that he was able to begin treatment early 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ rising morning talking more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I have worked , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning won &apos;t lose a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to start , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very at the moment tra@@ pped .
Helen called &quot; blei@@ b im Prozess , blei@@ b im Prozess . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make some t@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exempl@@ ary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia cont@@ ended the T@@ wel@@ ve Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe gel@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who has been in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee for 31 years , is 28 years old as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , the municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 towns and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ler , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ ling Bürger@@ meister@@ in Gertru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was appointed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget schedul@@ ing , calculation of fees and contributions , up to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high capacity ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there are always new additions that water li@@ ds and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived in a regular basis for the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practi@@ tioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of praise and praise .
on the one hand , Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller praised al@@ f@@ ond Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a loyal cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the T@@ wel@@ ve Association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the ship@@ w@@ reck in the high @-@ tank at church lou@@ der on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
once again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at La Scala &apos;s Scala , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .

relations at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man is shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) shot on his partner and killed them fatal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself by us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ fired and has a gl@@ at@@ ze .
in the meantime , the police has published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the responsible police in Lübeck didn &apos;t want to give any information about the wai@@ ver or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but she confirmed that a person was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing deli@@ ri@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened with green electricity extraction are from the table .
it remains in the release of the renewable energy transfer in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ausgabe ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furn@@ ace to produce electricity for their own consumption , to request cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry amounted to an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a charter agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe is suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw masses of steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers present price d@@ umping Chinese steel corporations .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have been pil@@ ed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price of the price is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp cau@@ ti@@ ously stayed cau@@ ti@@ ously on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is respon@@ ding to the difficult situation with further cost re@@ ductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not intend to excl@@ ude individual works .
in the German steel industry , about 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
they produced almost six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous year , as Steel Business Union announced on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the set @-@ up crowd went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a growing output .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt College , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co@@ hesi@@ on , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the pu@@ ff even in everyday life .
even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Sen@@ ioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through song texts and especially melodies , self @-@ demen@@ tia suffer@@ ers ac@@ custom@@ ed to long @-@ back events .
in singing , a special achievement is demanded for the head , explains L@@ enz .
concent@@ rating simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
even older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler thinks .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I prac@@ tise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks , have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the suitable offer Sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with internet research .
those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a cat on the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover what effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to her surprise the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved immediately in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ sty of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great trouble as scientists found out by the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
hang@@ over also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight males from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a herd of small ones , which were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from their mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were up@@ lifted in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers if this calls were played by the very lou@@ der k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already been investigating the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises in the past several times .
some studies also showed that women responded sensi@@ tively to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ße is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Turkey is again taking place an important football match . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Du@@ eling of the arch@@ ri@@ ties between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no halt before football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kom@@ ann is supposed to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdoğan .
although the exceptional conditions imposed for 90 days are still valid until October , in fact , most of the Tur@@ ks do not have any impact on the lives of most Tur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but in view of the dramatic experiences of the Tur@@ ks in the face of dramatic experiences , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cup winner , it will be particularly close to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its spor@@ tive value : with 17 gates and nine deposits in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record @-@ champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the SÜ@@ PER Li@@ g it reached only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the year was better .
first of all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the base for the 14th title with 26 seasons of Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ ains as SO@@ UTH @-@ Li@@ g arch@@ ers @-@ king .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of the coup attempt at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez could only be announced after the attempted put@@ sch , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of his estimated annual era , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay for his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who , after a dop@@ ing lock , had mo@@ cked her start right before the games , was blu@@ ff@@ ed and bu@@ sted at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with an open smile she was still up@@ set to the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as a stron@@ gh@@ old that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a storm storm .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most cont@@ oured figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion goes even faster than before , he is 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to ab@@ ort a six @-@ month lock after it has been proven by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don pain@@ kill@@ ers .
after an operation she had had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 World Champion of 2013 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the precau@@ tion and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tian .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive for 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , bet@@ ted Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world about 200 and 400 m .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ed , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete has won so many medals afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 due to testosterone mis@@ use .
the also recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was due to a verdi@@ ct of the International sports court A@@ CAS .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second on the world rank list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record woman and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion has found evidence of taking a prohibited dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ADA decreased mil@@ de and went off on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ terror in Thailand - Austrian violation - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in touch with the woman , spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cut wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left the hospital again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , it is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ alter was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another human being killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police investigations .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called several wounded .
one connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in means that it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ tri@@ j@@ ee Frei@@ tag@@ genau in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they did not have been informed of the exact time and places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ clear which group behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police instru@@ cted their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .

after the explo@@ itable bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confront@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) used for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military j@@ unta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , ad@@ mits itself to have led the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago there were also 20 people killed in Bangkok on an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the League have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; identity movement &apos; evidence of aspi@@ rations for the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we are seeing the movement now too .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ fy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions .
Ma@@ ate said that he did not have any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant to a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such people have control over the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ arten , he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have seen in recent years that there can be a right @-@ wing structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Liber@@ t@@ aler group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nation@@ wide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
we expressed concern that many ass@@ aults were transferred to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum are not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ enses or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example C@@ DU , SPD or Left , which , however , radi@@ c@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral intern@@ ment in social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special starting right from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well known .
since most sport@@ s@@ men are running in Ethiopia , have just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle , played no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compare with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a prec@@ urs@@ or over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ anned back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ min@@ ent elec@@ toral defeat so narrow
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative .
he then went on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he described U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist group Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trading with electrical tran@@ sports
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell her electric vehicle Street@@ sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether they are delivered to their own developed Street@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers , with the letters and pack@@ ets delivered to other farms .
post @-@ board Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always ques@@ tioning , about crafts@@ men .
following information from the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ factory fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and a layer .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and put a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Street@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GFK leadership comes after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann .
the rel@@ ic@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K had gu@@ essed that the chair of Chief of Management Matthias Hartmann becomes even more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
for the end of the year , the GFK Executive Board intends to leave the company .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K super@@ visory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
the management in the board of management will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September , shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hartmann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the rel@@ ics , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business @-@ policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person on Friday did not want to mention details .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ reise it was on Friday , in the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced two years ago had been great .
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ point since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes un@@ easy at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the quot@@ a so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s comparable quarter .
sales rose by 3.4 percent to € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million for the first half of the year .
earnings in the second quarter showed above all the company &apos;s un@@ interrupted value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company value sales of EUR 139 million were necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , which resulted in a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the stake .

accidents - Bus rut@@ scht in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ches : eight injured
on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured when an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her data to an opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite side .
the bus arrived right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency vehicle came to the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back to Pe@@ w@@ sum from a bus bus back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner District .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travelling company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and potential witnesses to report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fees per cubic metre of se@@ wage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ e@@ water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World leg 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after excessive cal@@ care@@ ous calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , with the approval of the household by the Land@@ rat@@ samt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was noted that for these wast@@ e@@ water facilities under@@ cover .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively due to legal foundations .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ shanks , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board , a new calculation of fees for se@@ wage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are to be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ vel@@ ing fee increases established Schmidt so that all three se@@ wage plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect .
in addition , the waste water flow in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , not least due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , in the back @-@ up period of the calculation , not least due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p for nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ e@@ water system the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pump@@ ing station , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed from ground up and in the pond treatment plant Lop@@ p had to operate the first se@@ wage slu@@ dge , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge was disp@@ osed of and an additional ventilation possi@@ ble@@ i had to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance was &quot; fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment expenses for se@@ wage plants has spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to stone houses , the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned plants will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous , especially since the supply zone of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wage system cannot be extended by these systems because it is a san@@ itation .
Bulgaria regi@@ sters inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % booked .
the annual average price of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the rate of inflation since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Leisure and Culture ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and Hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices stayed as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature has been critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its Filter@@ tool , it allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can transform into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ fits reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were acc@@ using that the Black@@ face app would promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them hits , false teeth and twi@@ sted che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow ges@@ icht . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y showed a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and in@@ dig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American student , wrote a twe@@ et on the photos widely that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inj@@ uring and the least unpleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradi@@ ctory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ wish @-@ proof , but that the yellow face was pulled into the det@@ aching extre@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than it was in the past , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and to do the same .
in an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the inclusion practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company publ@@ ishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ represented ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , told her that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;

the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence service , typically worn by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superior laws , to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com correspon@@ dent publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are carried out by the General inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely limited trial for the creation of intelligence ratings to I@@ SIL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress , while the inspec@@ tions of the General In@@ spect@@ orate were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the ministry of defense welcome controversial debate on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
but the alle@@ g@@ ations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic state had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger com@@ man@@ ders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
but they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will make the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way the other group leads .
as always the game runs on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising bu@@ zz with their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the National Team , began to turn things to a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely wi@@ ped out the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the pitch from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and led the ball to the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the top keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspi@@ ration .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself was a burning rod , which is cali@@ br@@ ated from the bra@@ cel@@ ets to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn off the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who , for the first time at the Olympic Games , and a wom@@ ens of women with di@@ m@@ ples , could certainly have been among these known names , which would be broadcast to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not univers@@ ally recognized : air du@@ ck shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et char@@ ms of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has already been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived as spar@@ se for the last 16 years that many people , I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that it is an olymp@@ ic portal at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping competition and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain outside character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a re@@ born enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending boun@@ cing ball - but also the Gra@@ zie of sne@@ aking and diving , the two sports that essentially un@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stepp@@ ing stone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke , and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to the performance , level of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
medal hopes have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but in television transmission also another highlight : the world or the Olympic lord .
the goal @-@ oriented aspi@@ ration is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I find out about myself when watching these games .
the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abo@@ lition of time and gravity .
it is so Zen how the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final hours as part of a weekday on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acker and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his following air , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia were fier@@ ce opposition to the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethi@@ op@@ ian moment@@ ary to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was not mer@@ ciful .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos on the protests that are pres@@ um@@ ably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security professionals strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expands at a considerable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dis@@ si@@ dents being effectively brought to silence .
many were sent into exile or imprison@@ ed , killed or driven into the past@@ ures of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a widespread vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the fron@@ tier to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the O@@ g@@ aden National Liber@@ ation Front , which were more or less defeated in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of ank@@ le @-@ nu@@ ck@@ les under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved Internet services .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they are staying .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians admitted that they gathered so much protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered , in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death on a non @-@ pub@@ li@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about the corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in using early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , which according to information from analy@@ st apparently p@@ opped by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ at@@ edness of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
in the last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist town , conducted by Tig@@ ray led businesses and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flight flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama have been founded I@@ SIS to be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the terrorist group Islamic State , &quot; not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication posed new questions on the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to protect him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain the peculiar position , declar@@ ations which he could not have meant at all .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ret@@ orted back to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created I@@ SIS .
but in an early twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy I@@ SIS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism cl@@ ash down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling up@@ take on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this subject .
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bor@@ ed .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism on himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rel@@ ieve on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump took an even more estimated tone , as its survey values have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading jump in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps j@@ okes his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation to have to face him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the m@@ umps of most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was ques@@ tioned about the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statement whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ bear@@ ers , completely false and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed I@@ SIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania , on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of under@@ taking his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he denied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tel@@ ev@@ isions that try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idential Office .
Café in Green@@ point lag@@ s behind at the price of the market
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front was supp@@ ressed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which won the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people were injured as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ aik wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ li@@ fies and is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new external source , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural reis@@ su@@ es .
the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez stated that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out of Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s price , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb on a regular basis .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee @-@ ham for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before the work and was inevitably always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

nowadays Ros@@ enthal still has his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez stated that he did not have a gru@@ dge on the fact that soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap with the cold @-@ fried coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .

a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ fried coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .

the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a rep@@ orter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ sp@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh bottle sand@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter ques@@ tioned ham@@ mer@@ ed , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little billi@@ on@@ aire that the ingredient sc@@ ans .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male fel@@ lows and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marks the ways that the country has turned into being no longer the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e declared why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ olle as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried out , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cuisine .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
like never before or ever , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - ab@@ dic@@ ated the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ wife &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delic@@ acies .
especially tasty are the reports of the government response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the milli@@ on@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to use his stomach an exc@@ el .
as described in the book , the leader of a house@@ keeper , with no interest in tastes by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , led the White House to bring about the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ est prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as how science has been applied to food .
the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e showed a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man added and added that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ ved a bit rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown lim@@ b .
amaz@@ ingly it tast@@ ed not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ dy he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a radi@@ ant symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think that God sees a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helic@@ op@@ ters have dropped four barrels above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a fro@@ ze 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle influenced by lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a Greenland shar@@ k which could be 392 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock that means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist assumed long ago that Greenland ha@@ y will become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin inhabited co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks .
their slow @-@ motion was , as they took six animals with a transmitter to the top of Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
prey makes this shar@@ k nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the polar sea and look for car@@ c@@ ass , which tor@@ swing from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , which catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ its@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest figure was 502 centimet@@ res .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as a nuclear weapon search slo@@ wed greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the l@@ enti@@ l core , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
all bigger Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Grön@@ land shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timeter might even be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length were able to arrange an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to sex@@ ually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the increase apparently at least one and a half centuries of time .
also this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ s@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck stuck a 120 years old har@@ poon pointed , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures frequently the organism of the animals living there is often running on as@@ par@@ agus .
so they later mature - and al@@ tern slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life .
construction site in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with themes relating to building , the municipal council has dealt with priority in the recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board accepted the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential housing can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after clari@@ fying the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing issues and the moti@@ ons could be placed on sur@@ vey@@ ing , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Section 1 ) for interested parties is no longer in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the plots in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ will@@ lige can report on immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to also respond to the rel@@ ocation of other commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change its newly created area of land use in sub @-@ areas until the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which is already proven there , is extended by two plots towards state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main therefore has the best chances of attra@@ cting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence center financial markets and property markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses should continue to operate from London to financial transactions across the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have previously granted approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is using just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk state ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg falls into a large fund industry , it also cuts off as much as Dublin does in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Seine are also the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Business Consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer , the city ranks number seven , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris in 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead obt@@ ains legal costs from h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an US State Jud@@ ge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for breach of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of false behavior on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion of opinion and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the cost incur@@ red during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to compare with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ ended each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which underlying Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
the troops supported by the United States have re@@ conquered the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city .
they have liber@@ ated more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , sharing Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just run up clearing work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , this resulted in the presidential candidate for demo@@ crats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton issued an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax statements in the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false statements and reti@@ re@@ es regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by tax authorities as the reason for their ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ vis@@ ors , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions were not completed .
j@@ umps critic , among other things also the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ usal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations to char@@ itable organizations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and posted a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump asks for his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke of the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump had paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked for Buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was likewise subjected to a tax review of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump took &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax declaration from 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
your main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were negoti@@ ated from USD 109@@ .000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by exercising volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method for protecting their homes and harv@@ esting without inj@@ uring animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Friday is the day of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Animal Protection Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dedicated to animal welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; expressed the Managing Director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the si@@ ege of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der is mixed together with a fire@@ work body wrapped in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .

Jewish director dis@@ integ@@ rates Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media tur@@ mo@@ il after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had no choice of Israeli choice , as Arabic guests had requested &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s pre @-@ selection list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is it possible that Israel has been eliminated and ext@@ ingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and cr@@ ushed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response from the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ went the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabic guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am ashamed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was stated in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all accus@@ ations from him and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police places Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police attacked tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police att@@ acking Gum@@ mates and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s proposals , Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying on walls against the pro@@ visional President Michel Tem@@ er .
the most recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dismis@@ sed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on sites of Russian companies increased strongly to businesses in the country , the ambassador addressed .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representative issued some 35,@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the Top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been committed on Thursday evening to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun @-@ weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had hu@@ g@@ ged their faces , then fled from the drink market &apos;s employees and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.70 m , so relatively small .
the beverage market is immediately accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the offen@@ ders must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking space located opposite the parking space with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .

Nag@@ old : game and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and joy@@ ful days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
in the quiet recreation area Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was quar@@ ter@@ ated during the first week of school holidays .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the Streich@@ el@@ z@@ oos .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group was pleas@@ antly surprised at the deep @-@ sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing .
culinary children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared corpor@@ e@@ ors as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .
workshops were made , creating beautiful gem@@ s made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the Seel@@ sor@@ ge@@ Unit Ey@@ ach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ s@@ way of all ministers in pres@@ um@@ ably two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg , where this year was a special pilgrimage to the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gates of Mer@@ cy at Frei@@ burger Münster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms arose in the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and granted pilgri@@ m@@ ages .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved his wife and thus started the pilgrimage route from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially formed pilgri@@ m song .
for the overnight stays the parish priests of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller provided for a tasty and also strengthening dinner and breakfast at the stage .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
day after day , one stepped into St. Peter &apos;s stage , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first had to desc@@ end some 500 metres in the low heat and then climb@@ ed again afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg .
the min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is was welcomed by Co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert in the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ ungsp@@ ille made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March at the World Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retired testi@@ fied a gap that Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic arena in the qualification round , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn round , however , Kenn@@ y pushed the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow down it , and to enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and liked Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they stepped onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the En@@ dr@@ unde we set up an Olympic arena and the World Champion prev@@ ailed .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was evidence that after a weak start he dropped off on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a vict@@ orious victory this time there was no such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he has repeatedly vict@@ orious Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 year younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and is going over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be defeated for a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ bles qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , which will focus on W@@ ig@@ gins with safety .
yesterday he fought with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is rel@@ ying on his strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , thus the res@@ ig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ bling and reti@@ ring of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land based on lifting energy demand
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , since the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy companies .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed during closure .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ks a closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , stated that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a Joint Venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; the company said .
AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; that would have entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenue from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melting process or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melting process &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not dimin@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang in 2010 , which would have been in effect from November this year even if it is still guilty of why it res@@ igned from the treaty .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the port and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements from the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land uses some 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ato around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts each year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV Star , Antonio is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or simple keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the problems Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a Senate Square at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls somehow participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may have sm@@ itten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West wanted to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself .
the September edition is the most sal@@ eable edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which rather resem@@ bles a picture tape than a fashion magazine , the output is attra@@ cting a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its cover star is expected so long@@ ingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine tran@@ spi@@ red before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the last few years there were clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the journal as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to den@@ omin@@ ators ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appearing on the last cover had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model critic@@ ised Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were high again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but walking around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters will sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal coun@@ cils carry out 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief con@@ fig@@ u@@ aries are reported annually by the municipal coun@@ cils , while the sector relies on the effects of further mi@@ tig@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already covered exc@@ essi@@ vely , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal coun@@ cils are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who rely on violent relations , people with insur@@ mount@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Cab@@ inet of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly remove these mi@@ tig@@ ations , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government filled its promise to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal coun@@ cils and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .

new York : Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ aig@@ n was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina ordered a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini gave up for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally , before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a gun , laid his right hand @-@ finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bord@@ ini in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had compl@@ ained about the local and regional campaign leadership , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was in charge of the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to make damage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution is only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate sol@@ ves a uph@@ e@@ av@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Am@@ end@@ ment people should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton was elected and judges were to nom@@ inate judges .
the campaign made clear that the media had ri@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not cont@@ end violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orda@@ is complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
W@@ CC@@ B , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
calls at his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , did not react .
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and C@@ DU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are drawn for the SPD and C@@ DU government partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north is slightly higher , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD crashed from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just scar@@ c@@ ely ahead of the C@@ DU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator launched the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received by fax at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proudly the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euro .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
nobody could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone @-@ saver of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold approximately 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone , alone 5@@ 55 million units were sold .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around € 400 billion .
these include the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and the telec@@ om concept .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication ator , everything by touch screen easy to use .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , still today , the iPhone is the main product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the following .
they finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks at 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone out again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olymp@@ ian spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games .
the Olympics presented great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we are already able to create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in swe@@ eping growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented imp@@ etus .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion for private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for ad blocking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors attempts to b@@ yp@@ ass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the display block@@ ings on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block ads on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the enco@@ ding for its adverti@@ sements to make it more difficult to recognize the indication of which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ yp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of ham and forth @-@ struggle between the an@@ zei@@ l@@ entic@@ ing open source community and the um@@ ers has been underway since the invention of indicator loos@@ ening agents , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has left the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying Indi@@ cators are for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , according to a study published last year ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers .
the company has put it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a spokes@@ person .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook informed that it would be an &quot; display prize pool &quot; to give people more control over their adver@@ ts .
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that Ad@@ blo@@ c &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we focus instead on developing tools such as ad preferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in suspected suicide on Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday was transferred to a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went to the streets and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was passing by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases where a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after being over@@ riding and killing a man who was in August 2014 at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , the court rejected .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman , who had responded to an emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate models : Venus was once habit@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have used similar conditions with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet was probably more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its Tag@@ ess@@ eite for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that has previously been pres@@ umed by planet scientists .
although it was once inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydr@@ o @-@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the best trainer of the le@@ ague during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed in each of the last two years the late season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ el@@ arbeiter returned to talks , strike strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties for a new round of talks sit down at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to re@@ join the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its counter@@ s in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the Company &apos;s advice to advice follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company give the space needed to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ali@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Par@@ liament@@ ary Member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years is expected .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ate in star cluster to different rates and in which connection the rotation periods are with the planet origin .
&quot; we hope that through compar@@ isons of our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies at 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , created around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
at peak rotation rates these mature stars exp@@ el large amounts of star@@ vation .
since these winds are traveling through the mag@@ net@@ osphere of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star switches , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between appearance of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rot@@ ate slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still a lot to learn about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
in three newspapers Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the press rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ guez quicker than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12th .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participant of the major le@@ ague bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was voted the most valuable player in the le@@ ague , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and a youth coach - in full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to achieve some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the retirement Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star awarded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was forbidden between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect who has received high @-@ performing funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the le@@ ague could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then addi@@ cted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again got the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a good@@ bye @-@ tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson said , sympath@@ ies of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted Xin@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court of Justice and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ec@@ owa was also sick@@ ened at the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went even into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ visi@@ onally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe must also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the Bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , approximately all weight @-@ lifting @-@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ec@@ owa &apos;s case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Federation had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the nation &apos;s nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier depar@@ tures in China had also taken care of the athletes for fier@@ ce disputes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt lila &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of freedom , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confront@@ ation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing dec@@ eiver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ resses Hacker ihr Lös@@ eg@@ eld
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently accessing targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 per cent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes increasingly on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ mail@@ ed is significantly higher than private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ant software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send adverti@@ sements .
then discovered the perpet@@ rators of black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database Files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
afterwards , the software presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in view of stagn@@ ation .
the hacker in turn knows this and try to build a good reputation .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
they explain their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access to accessible support websites , or dec@@ ryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate partly hard and pay five dig@@ its in order to get back their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potential high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , declares security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider of SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
however , it is more prob@@ able that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the old malware @-@ kits have been created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for other h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instru@@ cts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als then instru@@ ct sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful adoption , the offen@@ ders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price sc@@ aling , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the perpet@@ rators could in future take completely new goals on the Internet of things to the Kor@@ n .
at the hacker conference def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will grab everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit top falls down there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a locker of 453 l on high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic seat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like kin@@ os@@ ols and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the height of the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than that of comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
gra@@ ti@@ fying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested Top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( operates until Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assist assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because in the man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been evaluated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent Temp@@ or@@ egler is respon@@ ding to the road sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tling the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 2,@@ 9000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive gasoline from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 230@@ 00 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ free car .
Air@@ line is not liable : crash on passenger ship bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is possible only if possible .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
disease case : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their journey , sick people only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have demonstrated the same symptoms .
in the trial , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous fate .
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought the holiday@@ makers back to a defective se@@ wage treatment , which supp@@ os@@ edly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was in the opinion that the trip had been faul@@ ty - and did not compl@@ ain about the organis@@ er .
in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
in fact , the wast@@ e@@ water situation was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er was first informed about the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially as no contamination has been found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be discre@@ et and decided at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
sure , our country will not respond to the violence perpet@@ rated by the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if crimin@@ als would have to leave the country more quickly , however , this increase the safety and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium vi@@ erst@@ one magnit@@ ude over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be pun@@ is@@ hable again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon rightly so am@@ eli@@ ke that the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed tail light for physicians should remain intact after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ c@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior has declared himself clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the C@@ DU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a ban on the Bur@@ ka and the abo@@ lition of dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of enforcement remains proble@@ matic for constitutional law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot for@@ bid what one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules for example in traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to simul@@ ate action and action with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet spra@@ yers and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ yp@@ ass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ to @-@ law cont@@ our should be extended .
this is good news for all car racing drivers who are standing in traffic on the environmental road every night in the traffic jam , when they drive over the motorway junction Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße Land@@ scape Road by 700 meters .
drivers can then ride directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic inform@@ s itself early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the C@@ DU @-@ faction in the Münster @-@ West district representative .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder is anno@@ ying by drivers , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rück@@ st@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reaches the bridge over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alber@@ slo@@ her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one lane above the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer the required load @-@ bearing capacity to absorb two @-@ lane heavy traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the responsible hear@@ tland can &apos;t say .
however , with years to be reck@@ oned : the bridge has an official resi@@ dual usage period until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the prolong@@ ation of the legal barrier the country has deliberately selected the more traffic @-@ less time in the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables teenagers with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association has been offering the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to attend schools with welcome groups the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people of the class were coming from September 2015 to March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , is made up of language , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background should get the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical placement are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope of weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke through the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star bu@@ ds in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Persian , which with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest star @-@ bu@@ ds .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ schung and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , an entry and sleeping disorder .
especially the fall asleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines are also involved .
in@@ frequently , sleep disturb@@ ance is an expression of a different disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie poor@@ ly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worry , We@@ eß makes an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I get to the doctor with sleep disturb@@ ances ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eß .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any lo@@ wered sleep therap@@ ist in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary Sle@@ ep@@ medical Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , you should contact the family doctor , advis@@ es We@@ eß .
it can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory passages , in case of illness @-@ like day@@ time fatigue , in case of in@@ som@@ nia , or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , explains FI@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the c@@ abling , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a probe at the finger .
in addition , a camera at the ceiling distingu@@ ishes the sleeping .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of bolts that can be put on for a better sleep .
We@@ eß is counting on : regular sleep and rise times , not long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for sleep , avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start calcul@@ ating immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to do
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ track world champion@@ ships and at the same time he set up his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler turned to his own in the criticism of the ex team @-@ mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle @-@ king 150@@ .000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer had to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who cannot take a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the W@@ ADA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the choice Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of baggage Con@@ fir@@ mation ceremony
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ bags and baggage locks as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were collec@@ tively , working @-@ minded and especially professional .
the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate the di@@ vin@@ ity , who had come to Germany for the protection of crimes committed to Germany .
in doing so , they had a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few b@@ link pools , meanwhile another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in seems not like that , but the police are among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one crosses the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the local real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be portra@@ yed in the last weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several occasions for a tough police action against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ z@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the refurb@@ ished construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who plays three children here , are gener@@ ously gener@@ ously promoted by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted more police protection from the sc@@ andal@@ ous left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police make up between home occup@@ iers and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also today has a lower average and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a large police station in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing lin@@ ers from around the world in recent years : with them , residents from G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ iers divide their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on designed disks or newly painted faç@@ ades that have been cast with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours who regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like body inj@@ ections , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the off@@ ences make material damage , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been consciously moved into Riga &apos;s street - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the residents received their streets back : from police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the Deut@@ ungs@@ ho@@ arding over the district .
however , in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sh@@ atter@@ ing new buildings in former building blocks that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well drunk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone does not listen ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who anno@@ y colour bombs : the front projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who are moving should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a Knei@@ pen@@ ick , can compl@@ ain badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of the Administration around Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee help , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine customer of the Arbeitskreis indicates that the hon@@ orary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au that has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing - aimed at the multip@@ licity of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , it is just an urgent need for Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are standing in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you have to submit the refugees in their own or rented habit@@ ats .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ samt to local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , in doing so , one should rely on private dwell@@ ings , thus Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore community dwell@@ ings must be felt as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent place of stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who have to be strengthened or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so , there are offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to explain the refugees that it takes time and can make it reasonable for them , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach should not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problem cases too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers are honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ c@@ alisation after the recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could and may not excl@@ ude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them completely into ob@@ itu@@ aries .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region .
in doing so , they have always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question clearly answered , the policy is afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been busy integrating the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helic@@ opter wanted
the police helic@@ opter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are violent on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and sm@@ ote the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m big , probably m@@ asked , bore both Blue@@ jeans and black ho@@ o@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to flag the police set several squ@@ ads and a police helic@@ opter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flag@@ ration proce@@ eded without success .
perhaps the unknown actually fell close to the apartment or their escape .
