<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US champion winner was included on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of the German Sports."</seg>
<seg id="24">The excerpts include athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping stallion Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the hand baller Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports leaders came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious society emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza-Prize ran.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are uncertain about tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical differences.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to taxing the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively decline regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, it says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, there could be still party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we want to get paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go down, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is trump that wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, so the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture ending a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smiling and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to suggest his enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border crossing Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heroes of Pleven Commemorated in Moscow Wreathes from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Bulgarian Embassy were laid at the pediment of the memorial church.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin exalted and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the vew becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "for months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited personally from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after receiving almost his ministry at a failed coup d "état within the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-night rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicated cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West because of its response to the tried and tested power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the persistent resentment of the snail empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader of state won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d'etat, he called for support for the elected government organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me: two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now allied themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public atonement, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disasters, when NATO member Turkey flowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin warns Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's close confidence for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovo has ordered his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was the head of the protocol and staff head of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule of the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was toured as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated item - one could almost say - entrenched posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessicherheitsdienst (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north-deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "Deck blowers" "", "which approach the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an art of engineering by a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total deck ceiling is in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot of the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last block of road and its connection with the north tower in the extension, we had to close the existing gap on the north or shore side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tricky because the tolerances that the team worked out were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "says SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must in future show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but 20 percent of apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not entirely up to date: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for videogames in the 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand dropped slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and once found "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by the 35.000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of traced people who exercise 30 minutes each day, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "get out of the sofa" "" "and" "" "getting active" "" "every day, because many public messages are bored to health and come from people who look charming." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mürric game spoils that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they didn't give us reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will diminish with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans of Simone Biles contests on the Schwebestoken during the solo-campaign event of women in the gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a title and the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts her in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport in the last three years, 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals, including a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected her last trial in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans of Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning Gold and Silver in the solo-tournament halls of the Women in the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the team-ordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was trained by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gym where Boorman was trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a competitive competition, a winning series that will last for so long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sweden and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the world title title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears flowed on fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze figure in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her soil exercise she threw Kussheimon to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine at the Women's olympibia in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls from other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America rejoiced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were expecting unexpected, but masterful Gymastics routins.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans who won gold at an individual event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts come first and foremost in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, planning, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and their families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the communities out of countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing an affordable and easy-to-reach training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastic foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth up-to-date gymnastics which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-time benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des olympischen Mannschaftsgolds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls that make floorings.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the acting Mayor Lutad Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright detects his tongue for a travel guide to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throws in a serious test - by raising some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his course on a Euro leg, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the docking of each object he used a luminance to show up and to show us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed up under the title of "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leveling the rinsing button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bowel bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he was able to see, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his Darms by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to live up to his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His denture showed a luminous figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick himself after her luminous figure was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">Here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will equip Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we carried out crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Send us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added: "let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had caught some of the things I told him, just like the eclectic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 per cent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because it terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Tremopcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shockered employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were smelling holes on, wood panels were torn, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall housing, said that she fears that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this estate is thought to be considered not as a beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted with street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikers and floods included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47 whose name was placed on the lease, received an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall housing, said it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth's dream with the role of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say they are very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays a colder Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is reminiscent of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she says it in her song:" "" "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">It is wise, of course naive, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "she is very similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his glances, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "for the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the" "" "West Side Story" "" "highly topical:" "" "this piece deals with prejudice and fanaticism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful as they were at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30am and end at about 20 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty meticulously," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet-Tankstelle.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the start of the weekend at half-time until the end of October everything should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fee also applies to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to furnishing behavioural drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the building site was moved south on Monday and also the block of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was again made, the traffic situation within the place was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now leave the B 27 on both sides from Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive way through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable discomfort," "" "said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachalterstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality also called for a further strengthening of the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were considerable excesses," "" "says King, who made himself aware of the location himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute slotted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has gone further, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen do not like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, that the B 27-rehabilitation has led to sales breakthroughs for them, each one asks them to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with" "" "end customers" "" "are thus produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has little consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "at most slight decline" "", "but also states that of course" "" "the impeller is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploded are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment took its operation" "" "back for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his co-workers have to be discharged.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial balance with the hint that the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it also has to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties, where something has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been located here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are seeing less frequently because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That its stem cells return to the end of the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clients for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged men love panels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym non-Allemonsmen middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the manifold reformation of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a humble grey suit and litigate wild before I stop, hold my hands and define something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is gradually losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of records: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of records: eight men middle aged, one woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him at home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a sizeable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and will be prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people usually get rid of their collection by either 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that wake up happy youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the case with me as a collector so I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I fade through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Data: three men middle-aged) has noticed a" "" "Trophäenaspekt" "" "of the Revival." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here just recently and said," "" "I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only get started slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexbepacker pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagging mental trauma is hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window bumblebee than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records... "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the impression to patterns the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they are unconsidered, at least in plate shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record companies that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with safety, not by rambling through the record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through records, while keeping the stubborn gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter who raises no middle aged men's shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional business in which persons within the camp goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbours a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional stores, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "" "absolutely understandable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp that is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two auxiliary organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-s rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten at a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro grade here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji hastened a masterclass in the handling, side-steppe, backwards, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for Britain - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game among the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and let the attacks jumped out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one would run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolosau overheched in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A raging Tackle from Mitchell halted the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by other weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion carried a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB was still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for UK, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been running for a long time in favour of the South Sea Orders, whose fans saddled and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked down crushing in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalist match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotic gold than in those games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard Hieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the response of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they followed the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.4 unbeaten work, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of wild helpers who make the difference to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was a lifting trainer than the trainer who did not know before 30 months if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he was able to begin treatment early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened with green electricity extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the renewable energy transfer in the existing systems for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Freitagausgabe).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry amounted to an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a charter agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe is suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further, when the world's largest producer of China threw masses of steel on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers present price dumping Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel impact, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been piled up.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is unclear how sustainable the price of the price is." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp cautiously stayed cautiously on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp did not intend to exclude individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, about 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced almost six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous year, as Steel Business Union announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief increase in May, the set-up crowd went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a growing output.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in Lehramt College, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives," "" "says Erhard Hackler of the German senior division." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular cohesion, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs get out of the puff even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in older people arouses many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song texts and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers accustomed to long-back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special achievement is demanded for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks, have little talent, advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer Seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in touch with the woman, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered cut wounds and had been treated at the hospital, but I have already left the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thailalter was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "on Friday, two explosives went up again, and another human being killed according to the authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the popular seaside resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani at the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast called several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One connection with the explosions in Hua Hin means that it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "said army General Danai Krittrijee Freitaggenau in front of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they did not have been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "it is still unclear which group behind the attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the exploitable bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended on his homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) used for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary travel to these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) used for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to stifle chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, admits itself to have led the Kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago there were also 20 people killed in Bangkok on an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool, it allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misfits reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accusing that the Blackface app would promote white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them hits, false teeth and twisted cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow gesicht."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the Anime comparison.</seg>

<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>

<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the inclusion practices at Snapchat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership due to ISIS secrecy information, rejects the Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command impacted intelligence service to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Republican Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Military Commander, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence service, typically worn by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superior laws, to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements from Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom correspondent publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman of Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are carried out by the General inspector of the Ministry of Defence in the Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an excessively limited trial for the creation of intelligence ratings to ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, such as Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for deviating opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were recorded after complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress, while the inspections of the General Inspectorate were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the ministry of defense welcome controversial debate on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">But the allegations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inestimations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic state had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commanders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is calibrated from the bracelets to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn off the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who, for the first time at the Olympic Games, and a womens of women with dimples, could certainly have been among these known names, which would be broadcast to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV commercials if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally recognized: air duck shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charms of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived as sparse for the last 16 years that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is an olympic portal at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a reborn enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending bouncing ball - but also the Grazie of sneaking and diving, the two sports that essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "stepping stone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike, and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to the performance, level of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopes have to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but in television transmission also another highlight: the world or the Olympic lord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I find out about myself when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen how the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of a weekday on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attacker and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley anticipates his following air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia were fierce opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian momentary to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was not merciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos on the protests that are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security professionals strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expands at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the pastures of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the frontier to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which were more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of ankle-nuckles under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies to hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered so much protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered, in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are doing coordinating under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in using early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which according to information from analyst apparently popped by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal dispatedness of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersist town, conducted by Tigray led businesses and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flight flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama have been founded ISIS to be "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder of the terrorist group Islamic State," not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavour to protect him during an eventful phase in order to explain the peculiar position, declarations which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retorted back to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump spoke in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism clash down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling uptake on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism on himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then relieve on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump took an even more estimated tone, as its survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading jump in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to not apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation to have to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the mumps of most prominent intercessors, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trumps's statement whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back-bearers, completely false and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania, on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of undertaking his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he denied the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "televisions that try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps excuse as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Office.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>

<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnauspellosem snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh bottle sandwich with olive trees, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>

<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out, as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="32">Like never before or ever, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - abdicated the country's eating habits.</seg>

<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports of the government response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cake food attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he fed as the millionaire man of the world he has become.</seg>

<seg id="41">As described in the book, the leader of a housekeeper, with no interest in tastes by Ms. Roosevelt, led the White House to bring about the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most driest prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a froze 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle influenced by loneliness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "of a Greenland shark which could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock that means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionist biologist assumed long ago that Greenland hay will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin inhabited coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion was, as they took six animals with a transmitter to the top of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey makes this shark nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the polar sea and look for carcass, which torswing from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest figure was 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as a nuclear weapon search slowed greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lentil core, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities, generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Grönland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeter might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to arrange an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the increase apparently at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandsal, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120 years old harpoon pointed, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures frequently the organism of the animals living there is often running on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the SeelsorgeUnit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romsway of all ministers in presumably two years, the Oberministerial round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg, where this year was a special pilgrimage to the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gates of Mercy at Freiburger Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and holy rooms arose in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and granted pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster Unserer loved his wife and thus started the pilgrimage route from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis at field-crosses, chapels or churches always made Rast to sing together a song from specially formed pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish priests of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided for a tasty and also strengthening dinner and breakfast at the stage.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Day after day, one stepped into St. Peter's stage, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first had to descend some 500 metres in the low heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing Klosterkirche of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis was welcomed by Cooperator Markus Obert in the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jungspille made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March at the World Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired testified a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner scored an Olympic arena in the qualification round, but the New Zealanders conquered in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn round, however, Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow down it, and to enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and liked Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they stepped onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Endrunde we set up an Olympic arena and the World Champion prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, there was evidence that after a weak start he dropped off on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a victorious victory this time there was no such a problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he has repeatedly victorious Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 year younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese of Hoy is the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and is going over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be defeated for a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doubles qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, which will focus on Wiggins with safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he fought with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, thus the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbling and retiring of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like that the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, since the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be jeopardized during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, stated that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to say that the contracts are so-called "hedging businesses" that would have entered into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "Alcoas" "" "ability to operate the melting process or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melting process" "" "did not diminish." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have been in effect from November this year even if it is still guilty of why it resigned from the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of the port and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements from the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations said Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland uses some 600 megawatts and Tomato around 900 megawatts each year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "said Antonio." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simple keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped action of almost every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a Senate Square at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of cardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim may have smitten the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West wanted to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most saleable edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference, which rather resembles a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the output is attracting a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of its cover star is expected so longingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine transpired before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "over the last few years there were clearly more celebrities who model" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the journal as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to denominators).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce appearing on the last cover had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners do not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion has always been a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticised Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the mistresses of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters will sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy CRAWFORDS daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would suffice for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro lovers can buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received by fax at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proudly the price was: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have used similar conditions with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet was probably more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its Tagesseite for almost two months," explained GISS Scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus, which resembles the evolution that has previously been presumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once inhabited, Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydro-gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparisons of our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping sample, Geweightlifter Adrian Zielinski will not start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official Doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official Doples have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese Schwimmer in Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters obstacle course in Silwia Danecowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically criticized athletics contests, these messages come to the impossibility.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has already been proven last Sunday, which is used as a mask for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sportgerichtshof was confirming its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have participated in the precursors of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has requested the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full co-operation in the investigations," "" "quoted Xinhua from a Communication:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Court of Justice and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The news about the positive rehearsal at Danecowa was also sickened at the night of Rio, the 33-year-old went even into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this is an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "explained the athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to act in the banned substance for the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe must also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported criticism of the Bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athlete don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many are already excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, approximately all weight-lifting-fters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "" "was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabole steroid Nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, Danecowa's case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic Dopings, also the nation's nation produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the earlier departures in China had also taken care of the athletes for fierce disputes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data klau: so perfide erresses Hacker ihr Lösegeld</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently accessing targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be blackmailed is significantly higher than private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of pollutant software," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators of blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel- or Database Files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn knows this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access to accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate partly hard and pay five digits in order to get back their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, declares security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider of SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more probable that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The old malware-kits have been created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the dissemination," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful adoption, the offenders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price scaling," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the Internet of things to the Korn.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blockaded heating might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the wake-up ringing no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnia, that is, an entry and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the fall asleep many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines are also involved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of a different disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is most common in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie poorly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worry, Weeß makes an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I get to the doctor with sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, tired, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lowered sleep therapist in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleepmedical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, you should contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with respiratory passages, in case of illness-like daytime fatigue, in case of insomnia, or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, explains FIetze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a midday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a probe at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera at the ceiling distinguishes the sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="35">Weeß is counting on: regular sleep and rise times, not long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV for sleep, avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start calculating immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing end of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first took gold at the Doha short-track world championships and at the same time he set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler turned to his own in the criticism of the ex team-mates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 €premium and a jungle-king 150.000 €, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming-sport is bad, the doping controls on the other hand very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of doping or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deizer had to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "anyone who cannot take a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the WADA / FINA must not take part," "" "demands the choice Hamburg, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor." ""</seg>

<seg id="5">Against 21.30, civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the policemen from past theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were collectively, working-minded and especially professional.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "old buildings, a few blink pools, meanwhile another cobblestone pavement: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain seems not like that, but the police are among the" "" "dangerous places" "" "of the city." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">When one crosses the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the local real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be portrayed in the last weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel recorded several occasions for a tough police action against the project, the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadzschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrol the police for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the refurbished construction workers were renovating the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others converse vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are generously generously promoted by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted more police protection from the scandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police make up between home occupiers and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also today has a lower average and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer street near Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under a large police station in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polling liners from around the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former home occupiers divide their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on designed disks or newly painted façades that have been cast with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours who regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like body injections, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the offences make material damage, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as for violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been consciously moved into Riga's street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents received their streets back: from police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the Deutungshoarding over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by shattering new buildings in former building blocks that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well drunk" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone does not listen?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who annoy colour bombs: the front projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who are moving should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a Kneipenick, can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee help, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the Arbeitskreis indicates that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilchsau that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less ridiculing - aimed at the multiplicity of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, it is just an urgent need for Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to submit the refugees in their own or rented habitats.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to local community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, in doing so, one should rely on private dwellings, thus Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore community dwellings must be felt as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent place of stay, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who have to be strengthened or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "you need to explain the refugees that it takes time and can make it reasonable for them, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problem cases too," "" "customers are honest," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says clearly," "" "what some naive might call" "". "a residual risk could and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they have always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "this question clearly answered, the policy is afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher have already been busy integrating the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
