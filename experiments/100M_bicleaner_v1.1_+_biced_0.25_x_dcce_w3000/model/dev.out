Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
by Barack Obama &apos;s deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election .
in an emergency call , professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could do it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled in two Online Cour@@ ses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University polic@@ eman Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call for some time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time some tendencies were too proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doct@@ orate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ Präsident William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did a doct@@ orate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool senior guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5th September for the last time when Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth organ playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of anything that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including tut@@ ors , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt were also part of the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the Univers@@ ity@@ scape &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police said now that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss was referred to as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox mel@@ ts about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and an ar@@ mes@@ of from it to be with the princ@@ ess of Wales with a date .

&quot; back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict almost five years , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the si@@ delines of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that tr@@ ump will probably win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognise t@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to run their dollars flowing to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of t@@ umps have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa noted last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; enthusias@@ tically &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Iranian vot@@ ers believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number holds true in the nation &apos;s first elec@@ toral nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his post , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse down to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they expose their scholars , Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P vot@@ ers view the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is making nearly everybody .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to m@@ umps , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has harv@@ ested the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , in front of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only slightly more than half of vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly committed their votes .
of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can truly say never change the mind .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the immigration swi@@ ft@@ - and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of expression of Tr@@ ump will keep Hez@@ p@@ ano Americans away from the Repub@@ lican Party and humili@@ ate new @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday 6 out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now have about half of the support of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea wat@@ ts .
in the street , one square meter of a roof can@@ opy cost around 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student &apos;s book in Munich are not really little .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es Treffer ( 89@@ . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth act of starter in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had made a flan@@ k @-@ thought @-@ out shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal category , among them against notable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously in their offensive endeav@@ ors but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by le@@ ver@@ aging at Lin@@ ks@@ abroad Douglas Costa , who in@@ frequently encountered the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7. minute , the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by taking a direct take @-@ up , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bayern dominated its ac@@ custom@@ ed play , Pir@@ äus was able to set pin@@ ks .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56 . ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain drive with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC hero gave the green light only after the final qualifying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ hang Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first move , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially bl@@ amed Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c had obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of the host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when reno@@ un@@ cing , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 f@@ ou@@ ache .
the scientists had seen more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore caused by frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the haz@@ ard again sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people not to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Mr H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , leads to good dental health up to the high age .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking may increase the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter remains from the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhine shore .
for the repeated time arch@@ e@@ ological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum Skel@@ eton have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called land monuments .
in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist for arch@@ e@@ ological conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists now were found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission launches new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute over the proposed Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( T@@ TIP ) .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function equ@@ als far more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S @-@ commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de faced the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is expected to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the proceedings involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , a claim against their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , especially from large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a kind of parallel justice , by the companies poll@@ uting poll@@ ut@@ ants from tax@@ pay@@ ers , negoti@@ ating national laws or en@@ forcing a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the German Secretary of State , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission should take into consideration important issues concerning the reform of the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against limiting the potential of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the shy act@@ ress recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly captured by St@@ ev@@ ens talk .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender @-@ arranged songs .
where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart @-@ composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but may at any time drift into the great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a moving series : each of the 50 states should follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine there has already appeared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and breaks out positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returned to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Ill@@ ino@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 a nation@@ wide celebrated master@@ piece appears .
being bor@@ dered on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the amer@@ ican b@@ ill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs rose up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly traveled St@@ ev@@ ens return to intim@@ acy and folk .
without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to be modest , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo stage expects sus@@ pen@@ se
the new Labour pres@@ idency Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six forward questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance by the media is prob@@ able and the Labour MPs from close contact .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday .
in the meantime , during a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to wait for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; been in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported it as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also being st@@ acked within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are putting forward in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader , across the dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s cargo is too confront@@ ational and that he will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister is represented by him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that it became a car@@ ic@@ ature and required far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound went spl@@ en@@ sively according to data that indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building target .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ased estimates of the timing of interest gains since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.0@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % leap after the acquisition bid of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore stocks rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the holding company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages would je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the executive director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA plac@@ ard brings Leb@@ anese to the idea
potatoes or woo@@ fers ?
both - and indeed in the potato ribbon , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger ion owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his store , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been made to the Leb@@ anese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
Met@@ cash starts its campaign for the fight against Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
while Al@@ di was preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide Show .
I@@ GA tra@@ ders and suppliers leap on board , with brands such as S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publ@@ ishes further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual investors strategy day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of the I@@ GA retail outlets and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison with around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley think that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after the opening of its first markets and anticip@@ ate all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail dealers could lose $ 360 million in revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on a high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will decrease to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week had contacted .
IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in debt reduction in terms of net sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler res@@ umes and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ ate retail prices with col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs are to be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis board Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; special Ks , &quot; fell into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious engagement of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison excl@@ aimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp ei@@ pped a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty tired of is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi became a bit involved in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to have broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency stand and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed along the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with in@@ dig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter flew over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ashed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian pro@@ visional police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days there must be talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40.000 people who were looking for refuge in over@@ coming Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU countries would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swi@@ ft action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used during the competition to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as the entry point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the emerging economic refugees are searching for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high gate , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military which is expected next week , but rep@@ or@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of off@@ ending crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are here to quickly repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon was arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded in coming into , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants had blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win her against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is conducting the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ election , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and temper@@ ate , but these j@@ umps have decreased .
their support for the men has dropped sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders returns only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage with the older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic elec@@ tor@@ ate nation@@ wide say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question asked why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time to be a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ings are also cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the Vice President has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election be asked who for the party would be their second choice , then Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s margin increases from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions on the constitu@@ tion@@ ality .
similarly as in the previous month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ election suff@@ ers as un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results in some key features of vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary elections &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut with the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in line with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton are still using a personal email address and a server during office as an external minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ election are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of vot@@ ers nation@@ ally see Tr@@ ump as well as not honest and unt@@ ru@@ st@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump have good grades with guidance .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards himself rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in a nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers continue supporting Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out by Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flo@@ wed from 6 % to 23 % at the same time .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican vot@@ ers with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest level , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor @-@ Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in poll@@ s - with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey revealed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tr@@ ump@@ i &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
in contrast , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ous ritual of a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are submitted against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after den@@ g was power@@ less and supp@@ os@@ edly war@@ med an hour before they brought it to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien and set up the welfare of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies off every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attor@@ ney , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ guided attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an interest in interest comes , and the house@@ se will fall into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history for the economy provides only little guidance to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
thus , representatives of the US central bank have emphasized so fier@@ c@@ ely that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an interest in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual revival of U.S. interest at normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest threats can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be dimin@@ ished 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts in a more recent study to what happened after F@@ ed &apos;s interest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cre@@ ase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed faced some conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in case of inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were prepared for the interest of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were addressed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ onal heights made very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clear recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months up to now .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated its interest in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the cre@@ ase cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will lead to the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones suggests that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening have wi@@ dened and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond exce@@ ed@@ ingly three months after an initial interest in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Pat@@ ents d@@ f @-@ mp Dör@@ ries Frank @-@ Mol@@ nia &amp; P@@ ohl@@ mann Firm of the Year for Tra@@ de@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital ren@@ di@@ tions as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ vers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states a leading member of the parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also told the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; d@@ ull &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC &apos;s Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio played 3 far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er had to work harder to engage the audience when it did so in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport came under fire to tre@@ ad commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as judges - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when the next time it star@@ ed a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has hin@@ dered spending in November
for over a decade virtual shopping has dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts predi@@ ct that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG retail@@ er of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers travelled around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium finds out that from 5 £ expenditure slightly more than £ 1 was spent online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now operated via web shops .
at the same time , more than one @-@ quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ eral par@@ ishes in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia evi@@ den@@ ies the collapse of some of the giant Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane was killed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead drew their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ore@@ an cemetery .
the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession went over to the holy place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then upon praying .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral as the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 39@@ 4 wounded , imposed a sanctions .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ kas were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr. Ak@@ ram was in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have missed the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company foreign travel was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man came to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Grand Lake , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month .
the bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not at the disposal for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ e@@ ased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap ost@@ European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are target@@ ing arti@@ sans will be opened .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sold nation@@ wide will close
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its settle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified East European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their home .
if you can deal sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing crafts@@ men in order to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new manager from King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher intends to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , men domin@@ ate the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to shift this stronger towards a balance .
in principle , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group ow@@ es the costs for closing shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q features 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / Do@@ b due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Vic@@ em@@ aster A@@ ich / Do@@ b have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of abuse .
from this accus@@ ation , he was legally released in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the chief prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ vera , in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were vo@@ icing the funds they had been allowed to disper@@ se in their functions , for private purposes .
he cited the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
sports officials are also charged for financial transactions .
this fact was the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence demonstrated that at no point the association had ar@@ isen an asset .
sports officials used only expense compens@@ ations and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the li@@ abilities amounted to around 600@@ .000 sh@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told the financial officer in the bread profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely administr@@ ate the money , it must not be made any debts .
furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of expense damages was decided back retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore one has paid off some of the expense compens@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore l@@ ump sum and not detailed b@@ ush@@ ings appeared , the former chairman explained the operations .
the accounts and savings books shared the two def@@ endants together , the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association was not revealed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial bid , but it is important to have only the freedom of school , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 against the official investig@@ ative of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ au , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the Club account .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been noti@@ fied , the officials justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the officials said he never got a cent of salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure had been much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to submit detailed documents for the early years .
they were not stored more after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all homes are in cash , and he said he said in his statement from his hom@@ etown of international markets to the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing was continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .

as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will rise from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been concluded .

the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest rates for the first time have been raised for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view that F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent will be maintained .
it is a historic event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest paid interest in N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior member at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ under outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications indicate that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
die Todes@@ schüt@@ ze an der Delta State University left Ann@@ unci@@ ation
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when c@@ ops b@@ anded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ Präsident William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married approximately seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb canc@@ eled relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb ro@@ de his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University , like his life @-@ cl@@ aw on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a big group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives worldwide will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union there is a new negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and enhancing its low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the management team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employee was complex .
airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double fra@@ cture of his right leg .
while this led the left foreign def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PSV area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has it very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then the six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al pres@@ umed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when he is defeated .
the British def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PSV @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very serious injury this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that went in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad in doing so . I am so sorry .
the PSV player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better known ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be a picture or message we have missed . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph where Cameron claims to describe the action of the book , instead returns an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie that is presented on the Internet Movie Database website , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ prob@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an Un@@ named Young , like the local environment , h@@ ears swe@@ eping Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a sho@@ cking , pi@@ tiful being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it still is hard

related news : Adam Ly@@ th is eliminated from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best choice .
a long time ago the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully suggests further acquisitions in Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test blo@@ wer gets to set his character is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Count was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one could raise was that England initially deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een alongside cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four Qui@@ cks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made it to three hundred laps and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inners , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England made some wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what is said before .
Coll@@ ys &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a fl@@ aute by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y . &quot; is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is fier@@ ce for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , too deeply entr@@ en@@ ched in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ imposed agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturb@@ ing treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its Annual General Meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who desires a Great Britain inside the EU cell , &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s war@@ y Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it is done with the exagger@@ ated long expres@@ si@@ veness such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande glan@@ ces at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Self@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers possibly even plan inten@@ tionally not helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and what EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as it did during the 1975 referendum in 1975 , but did not support our 1973 ticket with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can still remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sc@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought much about her , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of serving his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had set the principle of the EU &apos;s non @-@ adopted constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door for him .
the press has never failed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it can take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just express it - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild flo@@ wering of Tor@@ ty &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ man can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the vort@@ ex of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe who allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ erable vot@@ ers - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of a somewhat remin@@ is@@ cent of the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they critic@@ ise public health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal , Lanc@@ et last month , laid the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on which PH@@ E established his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of PH@@ E that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include an industry @-@ financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the session by PH@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ron@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of the damages of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion £ a year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national competence .
BBC should give up the East@@ e , says former chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they would probably be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of its investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ e is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired of seeing how this is to be public @-@ law television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Don@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell the shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go &quot; to BB@@ Code , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue with their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify £ 4 billion broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for the £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s right because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ gn &apos;s mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and entert@@ ain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little of BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be informed , clari@@ fied and entert@@ ained at the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers will enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the activation of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are changed gene@@ tically to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultr@@ asound waves .
more on this subject : read researchers and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics which can be used in ultr@@ asound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ az@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ az@@ anis concluded that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves penet@@ rating into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels .
when ultr@@ asound is applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ az@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to move out into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic sh@@ ady company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish of bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that tort@@ ur@@ ers are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within EX@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are f@@ ond of fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from easily nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you say &quot; hon@@ estly , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you would not talk with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and tigh@@ ten their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences constitute a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .

friendship close through baking .
since you start the Uni at the height of the back mania , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ om@@ mates feel obliged to entert@@ ain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep@@ y when you tap .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drops of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added her milk a pur@@ ging agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , keep people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it would give them something to make Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same student residence by chance ?
on the contrary , it wouldn &apos;t be aby@@ sm@@ al embarrass@@ ing if you consider a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to get rid of them and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine when it seems .

town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ compress@@ ors
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ earned &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build today cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he is building row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
in view of the flood of refugees we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a semi @-@ terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it always makes the threatening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau and the placement regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for it .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Town@@ house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but do not shar@@ pen your competitive struggle for affordable housing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ dner : true it is : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I show how to build today cheap and well .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght will go back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by closing the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool , delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone might turn off half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member in its ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation supported by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .

district office looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s and the retirement centre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consult@@ ations one can also attend courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office has recently been opened .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and couns@@ elling information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too often many services of the insurance companies are not used , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new household err@@ in Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and civil hospital as well as for the Amb@@ ul@@ atory Service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken with the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the Sen@@ ior@@ enzentrum and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; described Heike Rie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center will see both executives in particular in demo@@ graphic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , as the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted himself to the meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able participation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang . 92 @-@ years of ext@@ inct
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus closed on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the artists &quot; house left an hon@@ orary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the broadcast .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was the president of the Austrian Institute for Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the re@@ building of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tim Wiese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thro@@ ws a polic@@ eman with money &quot; &quot; &quot;
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was dis@@ liked in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller once , meanwhile , Tim Wiese , ex @-@ nation@@ al@@ keeper in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
he wants to have a 30 kil@@ ogram of muscle mass in the past two years according to his own statement .
on the other hand , he did not put an intellectual emphasis on it .
me@@ adow made his hair cut in the Bremen city center , when he saw a par@@ c@@ ass guar@@ dian exhibited a penalty sheet for his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .
as a result , me@@ adow r@@ ushed out of the shop , def@@ ended the officials and threw her the pr@@ one fine in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether me@@ adow is shown , or not .

men tested Afgh@@ ans on 17 @-@ year @-@ old
witness searches the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , was following information from the police at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people , and sm@@ ote them with their f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismis@@ sed his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and went there demon@@ stra@@ tively several times .
when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured in front of the building went to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
with the help of a stroke , one examined the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
hi@@ ther@@ to only a v@@ agu@@ ely perpet@@ r@@ ator description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres in size and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and don@@ ors to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ sen@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen .
furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ pf Bürgermeister Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ sen@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a place in the next few months .
after a renovation phase , Müller again opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the teles@@ cop@@ es met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently complet@@ es her specialty training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in future , the husband Müller liked the idea of pursuing one &apos;s own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he will soon be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover were followed by several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ holz County and is engaged in voluntary work at the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon works Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both intern@@ ships , want to settle down as a household doctor .
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the modification , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of 500@@ 00 euros will receive a grant from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2,000 patients each quarter results in the practice of Fel@@ nis@@ ints , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another house arz@@ t@@ praxis in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel St@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone .
by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , also continues to look familiar with familiar faces : takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning force from the field stops .
with their par@@ ting ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little mel@@ anch@@ oly after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pressed myself against gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also elevated to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that also Slovenia would leave the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is what the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to preserve its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night hours of Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid regi@@ stering .
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly gathering at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik since then .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , direc@@ ting Croatia and Serbian media conven@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was it that people reject certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could now actually come to a somewhat more west@@ erly direction for ob@@ servers already predicted to shift the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call any details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have been a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing HOR@@ GOS , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings HOR@@ GOS and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
Wednesday morning Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic still tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local inst@@ al@@ ment in HOR@@ GOS : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high numbers of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there is still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ Hacker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , which is accused of having gained insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
the captured information should have been made insi@@ der trading on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were ens@@ hr@@ ined to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tra@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to have acted out both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has existed for 20 years
around the Mannheim parking place there is a rainy operation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large pla@@ ques with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped with this action to its 20th anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistant is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteers .
while a pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and read the phrase about &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for a long time , &quot; others stay short , read , saying phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ak@@ on@@ isches Werk Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which , together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , is the carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly express themselves on the boards , however , is understand@@ able , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open themselves .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lo@@ wered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company intends to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and € 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous predi@@ ction .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect , despite the price increases , will amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ dle carriers of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achiev@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holidays were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ .000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at EUR 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , accounting for the twelve analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which caused sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results from Fed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was decreased in freight business due to higher labor costs .
in the market trading , about one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen featured two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in .
above them at the end of the ador@@ ned , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unprecedented third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct it . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incen@@ tive through the short @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal loans , and it is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest in interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far from .
on Tuesday the Do@@ w Jones Industrial rang the average score of 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy keeps the set up this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they did not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest raise would re@@ assure the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was steadily falling under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereas the Do@@ w is now around 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would in this session attract the re@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , dissolved in confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they are not only super@@ vis@@ ing developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Corporate As@@ sets Management , En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , a unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advoc@@ ates a interest raise , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its lead by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of limited perc@@ ei@@ vable impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives dismis@@ sed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the fall of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest , because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with their 74 lessons she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers home at Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at a proper school .
Brasi@@ li@@ ens pap@@ al society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women in fact affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ ground move forward step by step : in the recent meeting of the municipal council , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously integrated without great discussions .
the committee , among other things , submitted an application for a construction law exemp@@ tion &quot; respect for exemp@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given permission for a special form with respect to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ ter@@ ry first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in turn , the roof slope , which is prescribed for energy reasons - is different from the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan per@@ si@@ sts no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the slope - whereby the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der community usually proceeds more restri@@ ctive with liber@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band sports .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ samt to the inspection .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Land@@ kreis district , confir@@ ming the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are implemented , all of the 50 staff members would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing inside station .
the rooms are available .
employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Weil@@ heim , so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the alter@@ ation has spar@@ ked the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to Joch@@ ner &apos;s white , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead as of October 1 , came into play and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
in passing over the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree to both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at the hospital Weil@@ heim is completed .
agricultural tra@@ itor Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came out against rum@@ ours that the House , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner &apos;s white could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief doctor for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal ad@@ mitt@@ edly is the clear favourite , but no one exists .
in the last season , the B@@ HC took a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and made some good fortune there .
hunting accident with two injured near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were badly injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn@@ field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police announced .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , a missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old det@@ ained also on Tuesday night , who indeed conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she came home on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not as agreed .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first hit the victim &apos;s personal belong@@ ings .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
the bi@@ ased was reported to the authorities in the inter@@ rog@@ ation of police , killing 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the port stand on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be further investigations on the immediate facts of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing problems
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable p@@ encils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution boxes on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
there@@ with there are missing 14@@ 0,000 flats .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first shelter .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .

Germany is pushing a residential deficit , which is greater from year to year .
currently , around 7@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in cities in large cities in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ inten@@ tionally longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the built @-@ in on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a rest@@ art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new incen@@ tives should boost social housing construction again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved for the tax fraud tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats will be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , an alliance with attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the sponsor@@ ship program for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start of the Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia do a cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no passing is more , there are more and more refugees who choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to go through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border with Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not pushing for border f@@ ences .
for this , the border strip ent@@ ails other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 days of attack .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws uph@@ old the over@@ coming and damage of the mar@@ ginal count as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , there were 94 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ it@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; established on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ it@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a total of 94 asylum applications , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees there .
however , practically no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be dep@@ orted there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
locking gri@@ ds have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this modification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also enhanced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government regulations .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor ro@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the shooting after the bridge on Sunday , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
but because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was at an end for them in Wern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border to the near Pass@@ au .
previously we had the un@@ hoped guests only once stran@@ gled , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded passengers on Sunday evening in Wels changed from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , in order to find the way to Germany after the short @-@ term successful announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try over the border .
the regional train was put off at the inn before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border border is generally high in the circuit .
the bridge @-@ proof united with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a brid@@ ging race - organized by the Union of Witt@@ els@@ bach and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping to establish structures in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially acknowledged the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism .
the suff@@ erer of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to restore decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35,@@ 000 winter@@ proof quarters
Konrad made his hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to having his word weigh@@ ty .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to provide neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first recording center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already gotten a grip on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have hom@@ eless people anymore in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without a big vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad is reck@@ oned with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodations will need to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 the countries will provide , 15,000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him of creating neighbor@@ hoods even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to hold a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful with accommodation , Konrad gives reasons for his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
up to now , its own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ suche has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of municipal halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because the persons concerned are currently unable to support these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ HTML 1.0 Transi@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; seal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) will conduct further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no more special deals with refugees to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the search @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria also re@@ establishes controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved to S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of what Nieder@@ haus@@ er has a lot to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
in fact Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get in touch with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is used every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are named An@@ gi@@ ers .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , rep@@ airing journalists or reve@@ aling knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the applicant for the US Pres@@ idential Office sharp@@ ens the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Ga@@ el@@ ian K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire date come from .
the New Yorker with the fres@@ her is a term for many in the wine village at the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dently the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ul@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group were the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home permanently failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once worked without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Folk Art , Roland Paul , declared Film@@ start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes mark@@ edly mark@@ ings of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the p@@ added , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was bor@@ rowed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bur@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the landlord Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t w@@ ander the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had his grand@@ father &apos;s time in the US would have been like he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , saw 12,@@ 000 cinema singers , even in the United States arous@@ ed interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian commun@@ e Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism .

in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared with today 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August today , today , today , today , today , Today , today , today reached 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the gap between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 .
until now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !
written by TO@@ DAY on Monday , 14 September 2015
the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , gave an average of 4@@ 46@@ .000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .

the decline in the second evening &apos;s quot@@ as from The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets to be revealed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may not kno@@ w@@ ingly reveal who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally landed Sam Wood at the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be reve@@ aling whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , checked out , you may have acci@@ dentally given notice of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become the game spo@@ ils who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes her and Sam Woods were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am un@@ condi@@ tionally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast to Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams sent requests for their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ Kon@@ verti@@ t at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a st@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ er Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass took place in his own in @-@ go@@ al area to a dry land for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger .

the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Cho@@ col@@ ates ch@@ ases until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .

Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the creation of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as they gave during the war in Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ anger required more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum inver@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need federal standardized standards in federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pushed , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after police officers shot rubber sho@@ ots on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber sho@@ ots into a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Inves@@ tig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ orted to rubber foam .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ foam used , known to which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confront@@ ation was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in the western part of Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ating the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and home .
you were waiting for corresponding offers , that is , on the part of the city .
which investor is in question , be not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no agreements have been concluded in this respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;

months had been negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new cottage settlement at the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Town Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
veh@@ ement reactions among the land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called forth the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a huge cl@@ ot@@ z over@@ looked by all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase sharp@@ ly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus loads have to come so that that counts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the construction plans were still variable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight regarding size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is obes@@ e and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital received data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ yp@@ ass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I of those under@@ gone this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes will be dissolved completely and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison to this diabetes , diabetes dissolved completely only in one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ ct@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who were subjected to an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried to conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone also added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for us to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is an issue that is increasingly observ@@ able in terms of fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , after years , meets the s@@ warm of her youth , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis is lying in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised German and Austrian efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how killing is less@@ ened in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent response of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
four@@ fold increase from intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low a strong alcoholic san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of proceeds from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison@@ ing control centers reported , increased from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and sad@@ ly a percentage of them lands in emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ton in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers supp@@ os@@ edly have bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in inf@@ ants , a few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four j@@ ars from the hand of hand inf@@ ectious agents at school , was taken into an emergency room for treatment .
her alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally regarded as drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency physician , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah ble@@ w her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors guar@@ ded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
apart from alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lo@@ wing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iled her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged
in the case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision on the cross @-@ p@@ liers between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been injured easily in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and took too late that at the round@@ about had stopped two vehicles ahead .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audience with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ involved vehicles , material damage was caused by about 10 000 euros , the police inform@@ s the police .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer pass@@ able and had to be to@@ wed .
Gerü@@ cht@@ ek@@ ü@@ che : no di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic

HE@@ AR@@ TS will fight S@@ FA for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and war@@ ns war@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cad@@ re
D@@ ons raise lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mony
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ aneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for confront@@ ation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ed Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mittel@@ feld player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not only talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you speak about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss ho@@ ver to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious on January @-@ transfers
despite his comments , only a few weeks ago , pointing out that he ha@@ sten@@ ed a few January @-@ transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is war@@ y of the signing of new and insi@@ sted that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players coming in the summer will have this pres@@ e@@ ason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary gam@@ ers to what you really need .

HE@@ AR@@ TS posted on S@@ FA Battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ erson was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Def@@ ender was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity ques@@ tioning , I have not commented on any achievement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ te@@ ase
the irre@@ plac@@ eable Hi@@ bee was assigned after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Executive Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it stands for the decline to end on the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es admitted that his crew from Aber@@ de@@ en had to fight for Hamilton &apos;s victory to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won anything , in po@@ kal@@ plays or le@@ agues , the games of this type have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the U@@ Ks , as shown by the number of the National Statistics Bureau ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ .000 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to stay part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken distur@@ bs the process
because security guards were unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in cust@@ ody .
a soft alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.89 propylene .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mi@@ sts and remained in cust@@ ody first .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the injection sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell all the story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emoti@@ on@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the de@@ ed .
but I believe a strong probability is that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police pursu@@ it persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man from Per@@ th to stop the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too keen on making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 cou@@ sins set his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired nati@@ ves to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tent@@ ative test in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; see &quot; as too high dro@@ oping grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go around and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to sum@@ mon me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of Route L , David Moo@@ die , president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this make me believe that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L de@@ co@@ cted and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on her and push her to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ strations have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ beaten master Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse run@@ way , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly charged mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day that was so .
but it was also like this at the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy goes back against ri@@ vals for claims of ring@@ ing
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called cri@@ tique of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the storm players &quot; Ring@@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Benn@@ ett gave a hardly envel@@ ope to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ bar of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the critic@@ isms of two leading coaches in his team voice him confi@@ dently , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ ing , when she struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing of our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this always emerg@@ es at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wayne claimed he would take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
they didn &apos;t think about us six weeks ago when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm versus Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have points something spann@@ ing ?
for me it is the maps .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the final round at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200@@ ,000 $ deposit to drug policy
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a 200@@ ,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested for the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for attempting to possess a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café would have been out of a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .

he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of a complaint , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200@@ ,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate from the last moment to the left as the police told .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident maker ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord were completely closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g took the phone of the girl when he was sleeping , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hog@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; Web searches , which used terms for the search for un@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hog@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be addi@@ ction that he was addi@@ cted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ iles .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the unbe@@ ar@@ able pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the appeal of the Indi@@ ctment to have recorded in@@ consistent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared in court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g would not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael disappeared the verdi@@ ct until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was given security deposit in this case , but was kept in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual crimes before the date of the judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up off the large @-@ scale control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many h@@ aul@@ ers left out of fear of discovery and arrest of people in smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot via bridges and sto@@ wage pipes to the German side .
there they are received by Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich central station , a lot more refugees arrived on Wednesday in accordance with the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 am alone , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of checks on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : er@@ un@@ ner of Trop@@ enst@@ urm &quot; Henry &quot; wa@@ its in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , shared by Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the bo@@ gie of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the last days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the lake with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer period .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their new products at the I@@ AA .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations ac@@ counted for this segment , according to Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars will be presented in a number of new compact models .
the Opel Astra is one of the largest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automotive industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
R@@ üssel@@ sheim . Opel provides an entry level below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault announces the fourth generation of its Astra competition .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and ac@@ cent@@ red sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , the trade will also be available as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is quite new in the segment .
the Nissan Ab@@ leger wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the supply also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s instructions with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented on the outside hand at the front part : here the radi@@ ator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by tou@@ ch@@ screen and integrated with Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new versions , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI are added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are decent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison complex Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to judges , the persons concerned may even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , was transferred to a larger cell .
his complaint accus@@ ations due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ review .
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days Haf@@ tt@@ age were author@@ it@@ ative for compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a c@@ unning of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Jud@@ ges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they spoke only in April to a prisoner compensation , because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a decent housing in a Par@@ allel case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was housed in a homo@@ geneous cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case daily between 15 and 21 hours a day .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines for lack of personnel over the past few weeks .
for this reason , prisoners are constantly locked into 23 hours of aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to h@@ unters it is said to have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 shall be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments also refugees will apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 80 000 social dwell@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to develop annually , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there will be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long run .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ iller , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers confined to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - even because of the short@@ age of skilled workers - there is a majority in the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg zur Arbeits@@ integrating .
the Berlin School Management found that only a few fled their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ailed parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diagra@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes papers in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise dramatically through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - for example by allowing more training schools .
in the countries , pupils are prepared for lessons without German knowledge in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age of them , Beate St@@ offers from the Berliner Schul@@ verwaltung .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no Federal State denied asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( C@@ DU ) has given up his attitude .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ aff@@ led persons .
toler@@ ated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ens these Spani@@ ards to 15 months .
but this funding gap needs to be closed , too , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely acc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church right to develop a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers , is also important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and an introduction to gender equality for a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant workers and the interests of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention require Germany must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees previously expected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls upon all the com@@ ers to susp@@ end the registration of health cards .
the services rendered could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to det@@ ra@@ ct so many people with the limited power catalogue submitted by the asylum application law .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are ill @-@ educated about their diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpretation costs should be taken over , it demands .
however , many refugees have been helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among refugee children , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partial other illnesses , German doctors would come from their education , but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ it@@ osis or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the short@@ age of doctors , even alle@@ vi@@ ation is possible by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system ; several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly need further ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Security System ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suff@@ ers from among other things to so @-@ called fl@@ ash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturb@@ ances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
although mentally ill seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social centres , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social @-@ offices usually Sach@@ be@@ arbeiter or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege charges to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion &quot; the Cir@@ cus celeb@@ r@@ ity acc@@ esses the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites into the arena on the brick @-@ brick v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for spiritu@@ alization is thus the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to bring people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films the Cub@@ an duo wants to take up loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
except through numerous salmon sal@@ aries , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with flair and artic@@ ulation .
balance the unic@@ ycle on a bullet ?
for He yuan no problem .
sn@@ ak@@ es@@ man fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little other and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; st@@ resses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst offers its performances every day from September 17 to 20 every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the programme begins at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 : 00 the prices are reduced .
the animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium by a podium .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also troubled by alle@@ g@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with calls .
during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament last month , she interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers to politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring in order to tackle the rep@@ ay@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ idency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone not well @-@ cured .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developing an unpleasant design .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd. reports 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 cases of ar@@ sen@@ al 157 le@@ ague games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er le@@ ague clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have seen most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wedn@@ es@@ days , and Wen@@ ger is presenting a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need to afford a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has with@@ drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend@@ s@@ festival : the Com@@ edy Show , which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health far more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the Schön@@ e bei Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the soccer field in cozy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone attention it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who feel de@@ pressed and je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term turn@@ around mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episo@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help him to gr@@ ind Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets during his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps him pass by on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG @-@ player who led the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim at the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but an improvement on the road to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could last a 2 : 2 deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing r@@ ushes were referred to as the man who took him to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he crossed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that he would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , there were sometimes even some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he had a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shooting which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this concluded all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result down , before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that he played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat@@ s off from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , the Bayern Munich was shortly before the obligation of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we have nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Munich .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not shift
but the change did not come about .
and the be@@ ating man is working for the German record champion today : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contract Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time had run 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King classes triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the variety and said she will not need behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with respect to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scre@@ en@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian consolidated themselves .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove struck by her white hal@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People used the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO WHITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et conden@@ ses more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement achieved nation@@ wide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to land discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour@@ less restra@@ int .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still weaker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered an hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entert@@ ainers , producers and media players who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sports climbing and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ eram@@ an Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the final .
the last task was to climb on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten finished the task in time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Br@@ itten , although he first ended the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said .
how much the money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting angry about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received thousands of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by anyone , then I am glad he is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an A@@ cht season , the fil@@ ming will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ d past Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 at the target field on Tuesday .
the Twin@@ s w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a half board of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ star hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle nav@@ al on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done well the be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bul@@ l@@ ley , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three laps at the end of the seventh tournament , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to get back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton termin@@ ated the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a st@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who torn between the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion Run in the second Ver@@ hagen produced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit joined an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth place , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed stab@@ bed S@@ ano from three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three laps in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled due to the game from the vulner@@ list after having missed more than a month due to a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started moving and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded in scor@@ ing his 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single at the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers recorded in the second one , a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose turned to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big hit , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not beat well , but he caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strips .

a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen state capital have been prepared for this fall over the last few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government pres@@ idency of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have arranged emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military action in Syria is an option &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective p@@ age@@ views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict now lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann request a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee quot@@ a in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries in the first @-@ time and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday night after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who need protection , they also prof@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who have no perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been dealt with in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees meanwhile stuck in the can@@ yon route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the Budapest government announced to tie up the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asi@@ ve routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its way around the ring planets .
although this de@@ ve movement is only small but still too big for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered iron volcan@@ oes on the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ las@@ hing water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night on Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws partly with storm strength through the con@@ cili@@ atory valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western flow .
on the Alp@@ illes side , the night falls on the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws up on Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ ation@@ valleys with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and specially in the Ur@@ i area with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in parts to the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ i@@ xes of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fe@@ ed@@ ries for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the slope of the Alps .
here is ra@@ ining , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps with some 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n opens up the air , in which a cold front rolls with strong , sometimes we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind blo@@ ws heavily to stor@@ my , and temperatures are falling sharp@@ ly .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ place in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
the square is symbo@@ lic@@ ally visible in the symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a comm@@ enting sin@@ ner b@@ abel .
his negative impressions might have reinforced him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent church with his theses against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorn is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year @-@ old - but it is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles which focus on topics such as cross @-@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the various Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 year old to allow double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant sovereign Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened to the cane &apos;s stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to work with the Lord Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art more important in the quick@@ est way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is today marked by advertising , and it is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is supp@@ ressed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers come into the pictures , letting them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its object . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Old Bible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ avi@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ hler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway

so hill dep@@ orted , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first community @-@ worker Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga illustr@@ ates a clear sign on the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting to everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive course must be policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ten@@ ecker instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ship @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We can help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting director Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama @-@ drama happens every one , nobody should be able to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer players , no , we have to use our radi@@ osity , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig compl@@ ained about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach marked the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places had started their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief of SAP lost an eye in accident
the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye through a crash in early July .
during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , impot@@ ent , then went out to the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board Meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully capable of working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wick@@ er in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game in the Europa League have finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach will be open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its parent eleven at the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of St@@ arten@@ ders Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if the turn@@ out is used in all European le@@ ague games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ ein@@ zug for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot car : government wants pione@@ ering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Auto Show I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a swi@@ ft increase in digital radio transmission .
there is currently a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are infl@@ ated , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to deplo@@ y around internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per kilometer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which has previously only seen man as driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data within seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD spokes@@ person S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still view scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .

in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least 15 percent imagine , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each V@@ ierte would leave the car under no circumstances .

according to current status , the Düsseldorf wants to beat only in sing@@ les with the title fight from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is scheduled to fall on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys know it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ strainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the Euro apprentic@@ eship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long term agreed sponsor@@ ship event in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo was also ste@@ aling , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world @-@ ranked fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his approach to a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ c@@ ely looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which was used for much effort : in order to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
14 tons of material lost the cre@@ ators according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tiers of old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashionable obe@@ dience of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
but later I bought them of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace fashion played a larger role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styl@@ istic periods , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use niche in the textile business in Germany is no longer on the market .
we have already completed half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien , together with nine other companies .
only they must carry the protected label .

our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , the export is weak@@ ened , currently in Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year we have been leading a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Aus@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine bu@@ cks small chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ piece Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional pl@@ um tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and would like to have a souven@@ ir .
this way I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of continuation of 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy needs to open up to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , the promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it points to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers that are transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as announced in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ border value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thereby consume the consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve tox@@ icity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organis@@ ing Food@@ service , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ World@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish have already been so heavily loaded with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cor@@ rid@@ ors are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish@@ ings from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ cks , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeuvre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for the human being , which is strongly enriched over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly in un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion .
according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations viol@@ ate Ann@@ al@@ ena B@@ aer@@ bock with more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface coverage , &quot; had cited the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from paper .
last year , throughout Europe , war@@ nings against mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
