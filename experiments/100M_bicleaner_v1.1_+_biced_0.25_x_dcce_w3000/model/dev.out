Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal applied by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girl@@ friend shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told me about the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family acts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was bent on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could make it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where he had shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ben@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made a fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doct@@ orate , for whom the Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that can no longer be answered .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he drove back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said they believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doct@@ orate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool senior guy who tried several years to teach her playing guitar .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and dwell in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ mits to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago both on a summer fair market .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth organ playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of anything that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean@@ room and were jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the Dead Professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American nati@@ ves and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated also at the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the universal &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there was no indication that the two had ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .

most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December increases .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies prepare themselves to hire temporary workers to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox s@@ ails over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and a length of length away to be with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon tells Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the General Meeting of the General Assembly this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Wirtschafts@@ gruppe Club for Growth now acknowledge the per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the property Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of t@@ umps have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa last week noted that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of Irish vot@@ ers believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first elec@@ toral state of the nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for an Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers get ac@@ custom@@ ed to the idea .
when they expose their schol@@ arly hus@@ bands , repub@@ lican vot@@ ers consider Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten said that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P vot@@ ers consider the campaign to be plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to t@@ umps guidance , while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates diff@@ use .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ests the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ bal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago was the immigration hub and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive Hez@@ p@@ ano Americans away from the Repub@@ lican Party and humili@@ ate the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they would rather want a political out@@ sider to be someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea wat@@ ts .
in the street , a square meter of a roof building will cost around 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular locations one square meter costs most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros ni@@ x - per square meter , mind @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the foref@@ ront here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 89@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth season of starter in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race .
Müller won at his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bayern management good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a flan@@ k conceived as a flan@@ k of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bavaria captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without sh@@ ines .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund moved here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European Championship du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to works .
the attacks were often initiated by way of playing on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , which rarely happened against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner .
in the 6@@ 7. minute , the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ aded with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bavaria raised their ac@@ custom@@ ed play , Pir@@ äus was able to set con@@ i@@ fers .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was lost .
for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 56 . ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola ordered a four @-@ string with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC hero gave its green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ vor@@ platz Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to make something different is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it .
in front of the game it was at the stadium for cra@@ w@@ ling .
after a smaller group of partly displac@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of the host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 feet higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fied if smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the high age .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on remn@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity on the banks of the Rhine
for the repeated time , arch@@ e@@ ological findings were made at the right bank of the Rhine .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all building projects in the city area of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist department for Arch@@ ae@@ ological Natural Monument Care .
in the third construction section of the Rhin@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to remn@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
in order to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the disp@@ uted private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function equ@@ ates considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has to introduce the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is expected to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eded con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the proceedings themselves agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment tri@@ bunal according to their own specifications .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) primarily required by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a kind of parallel justice , which companies can enter damage rate by tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission has taken into consideration important points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens talk .
he tells the story of various places that he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderful creative person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been published in 2003 , which harmon@@ i@@ ously nest@@ les very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is expected with sus@@ pen@@ se
the new Labour chair@@ woman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance by the media is prob@@ able and the Labour MPs from close proximity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could ski@@ p several sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to pers@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several cover stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; been in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ack@@ ened within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s ques@@ tioning is too confront@@ ational , and that it will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister is represented by him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Leb@@ anese to the potato d@@ iner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it goes both - and in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster by the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster in a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he saw on TV .
since then , in his store , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of Leb@@ ese has meanwhile introduced itself to the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with his clients , the culinary international understanding is good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash starts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boden@@ stan@@ dig@@ kei@@ ts campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - invasion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a stand @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ alpha invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA retailers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and sell shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell tickets for the South Australian football le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publ@@ ishes further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances condu@@ cts its annual investors strategy day .
there is much emphasis on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyer pays € 10 for shipping.Attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is7 euros . &#91; ... &#93;
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states after the opening of its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley expects sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and grocery stores , which are about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in net sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler we@@ ars and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ ate retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programmes are to be set to Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves to be praised by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; got into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison were separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , with Har@@ rison excl@@ aimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f failed to win a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am pretty exhau@@ sting is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ it .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has done very fast to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency stand and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with in@@ dig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter flew over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels to make no common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were looking for refuge in the over@@ grown Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ stated that his country is also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison camps were used during the competition to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are searching for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ or@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country safety advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of being off@@ ended according to the new laws .
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials opened two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and press a crowd to push down there .
about 20 it was possible to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former U.S. Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the Pres@@ idential Office , receives 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more permanent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and temper@@ ate , but these proj@@ ections have decreased .
their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage of democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage in the older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the local elections say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less repub@@ lican vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time to be a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ings are also cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the Vice President has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see it in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for the election , whoever is their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide for nomin@@ ating the demo@@ crats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions on vot@@ ability .
similarly as in the previous month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections is un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some key features of vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut with the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
democratic vot@@ ers in general elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers has no view of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , the majority of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ election are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of the voting rights do not keep them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time 55 percent of the voting rights nation@@ wide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes in leadership .
the six tested candidates cut bees , Car@@ son and Bush best in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees himself rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not have a view of him .
the fault rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times poem behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received from demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Repub@@ lican vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ sts for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ umps &apos;s belief in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bath in northern or Baltic is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with .

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Fr@@ at@@ ernity attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police communicated with him .
officials said he was loaded with associated eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supp@@ os@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and set up the welfare of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said forem@@ an Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with st@@ ump power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an interest raise comes , and the house is falling into circulation , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history for the economy provides only low instructions on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first compo@@ unding increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest threats can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be dimin@@ ished 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after interest threats of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which released Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the rise cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest threats often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest raise of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest threats since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made a cement of interest all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade is only a lik@@ eli@@ hood of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all elev@@ ating cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ onal heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market decl@@ ines a interest raise , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than if they change their strategic course .
at bonds , the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the rise cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates is to draw closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ tist at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ers have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest are most likely to lose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the Sender for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly in@@ distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ i@@ cked The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ cast@@ ers to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &apos;s conserv@@ atives also told BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you are actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works on behalf , I really think it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder is needed to engage the audience when it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports led under fire to tre@@ ad commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order of further ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slo@@ west and Black Friday can be responsible for this
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month there was the lowest income since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed the expenses
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared with the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG retail@@ er of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers began to buy purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times passed the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that from 5 £ issues a little more than £ 1 was spent online .

the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi authorities have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said not to stop the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what caused the overthrow of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also addressed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ e@@ ased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in 1990 .
the collapse of the crane arrived amid@@ st strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales positions will close nation@@ wide
von Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is said that British sett@@ les their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European crafts@@ men who carry out their work in their home .
if you can b@@ yp@@ ass with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , nowadays you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform home @-@ based jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new manager of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
in general , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group was paying the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / Do@@ b for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / Do@@ b have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of abuse .
from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the chief prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were vo@@ ided by club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes .
he deci@@ ph@@ ers the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports @-@ function@@ aries are also charged with financial transactions .
this fact was the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not a asset to the association at any time .
the sports @-@ function@@ aries would have calculated only expense compensation and the sports club for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va em@@ bed around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the Brot@@ beck &apos;s large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our li@@ fest@@ y@@ les laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there may only be no debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a corresponding financial success , the pay@@ out of the expense compensation has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore you have paid a part of the expense compens@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , package form@@ work and not detailed entries seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings books shared the two def@@ endants together , the second def@@ endant said .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial bid , so important is only the freedom of school , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros had been transferred to the club account in 2011 .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
then he finally thought that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been noti@@ fied , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never obtained a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the accused .
these were , after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , did not have been kept any more , they explained .
kilomet@@ re money also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all accommodations are in cash , in addition to this , he had to go to the Bank of Blei@@ burg from his home country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ ains additional 30,000 jobs
in addition to operating personnel mining for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment during its restructuring .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall off the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been concluded for the past three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company generated with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .

40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
after that the police used tears .
much of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US National Bank
the world is observed when the US central bank is coming together on Wednesday and Thursday in order to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time since almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will be kept .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed paid interest in N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
die Todes@@ schüt@@ ze an der Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; p@@ ity &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said the staff of the emergency call center that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sho@@ ok my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he studied E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ eman killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married approximately seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; K@@ now@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , on that night , Lamb picked up his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb picked up a doctoral degree from the Delta State University , like his W@@ ro@@ cl@@ aw on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the Group &apos;s conversion to the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , there is no new negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year resulting from cost and rede@@ mption sy@@ ner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger &apos;s business .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in the management team headed by Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the pilot union cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be res@@ umed after the judi@@ ci@@ ary on this Thursday .
this shared the union with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of the talks should be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retirement regulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in recent months , the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes .
in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of pilots , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own balance line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double fra@@ cture of his right leg .
while doing the left foreign def@@ enders for crying and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PSV area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double fra@@ cture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be rel@@ oc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the suspension of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when he was defeated .
the United Kingdom Def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PSV Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that went in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PSV player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ eplay by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message we have missed . &quot;
everything beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 film version , added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see a real tree , &quot; he reads . a love affair was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , li@@ stens through the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees lo@@ oming , Th@@ need stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it still is hard
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series failure is not on my map .
I would not excl@@ ude a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is eliminated from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I said that - players are their own best choices .
a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully turns out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and this doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to put his sign is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one could raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must at least get the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to beat Mo@@ een alongside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and received four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred laps immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inners , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of Backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the Batt@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for testing games could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing @-@ cabin , even if the messages are in line with what they said before .
Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain from the EU ) could win Zul@@ u if the economy was in a fl@@ aute up to 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Ja or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was fier@@ c@@ ely fier@@ ce for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are deeply rooted in different crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturb@@ ing contract changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wants a Great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials arrived in some capitals to the point where they no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it is done with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term endurance such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande faces his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the British self @-@ Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even plan inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , pres@@ umed my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ äu@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one as they were in 1975 inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sc@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ h@@ acking aliens and pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar about her , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 .
the press has never been able to delay it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ 80 years , a mistake back then and today .
it can take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I think it is friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ änder@@ ismus can say yes everyone to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow @-@ law was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be on television so il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mate , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free map for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political funds - they also have a susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of when starting on Monday , what was called British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England using e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fund@@ amental Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which PH@@ E established his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously provided by British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide an industry @-@ financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the session of the tobacco management of PH@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ lic@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear clari@@ fication of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .
BBC should give up the East@@ enders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time @-@ window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least consider its production on programs that others do not do or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to look at how this is to be public @-@ law television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ conference lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows should sell like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue if they &apos;re going on their seem@@ ing missions to justify £ 4 billion broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and entert@@ ain their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should change in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , clarify and entert@@ ain in the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells to be gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
more about this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves that then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves function on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultr@@ asound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily pr@@ one the accumulated human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and wi@@ el@@ ded corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is an intru@@ sion of the British government and the guarantee that tort@@ ur@@ ers are not negoti@@ ated illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors have fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to the residence halls ranges from easily nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken the Sabbath , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly , Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your las@@ hes were burning and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear themselves and calcul@@ ating their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy that I have spent for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
since you start the university at the climax of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck is at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of browsers , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got something to give you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feels committed to entert@@ ain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .

semi @-@ detached houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a totally ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a semi @-@ detached house needs least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 thousand euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took place .
this is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly drawn my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , it always makes the threatening D@@ amo@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau und die Stell@@ platz@@ ver@@ ordnung .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ min@@ ed who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for it .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely does not match .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ative mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am showing how to build cheap and good today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the release of the updates . it will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is up@@ loaded while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be res@@ umed , as the phone may be switched on half @-@ way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has taken another member in his ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and hon@@ orary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , who received the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of its clos@@ eness with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Alten@@ center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consult@@ ations one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
there was recently opened a new district office .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and couns@@ elling information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely many services of the insur@@ ances are not claimed , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist and civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the Sen@@ ior@@ enzentrum and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sen@@ ior@@ Center for Care and Care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both executives in demo@@ graphic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential .
moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ operation . &quot;
the social foundation makes a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9@@ am to 2@@ pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm .

Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the artist &apos;s house lost an hon@@ orary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann .

witness searches the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried to the young people , and sm@@ ote this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs , he first dismis@@ sed his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and went there demon@@ stra@@ tively several times .
when you couldn &apos;t see the car any longer , the injured one in front of the building , to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be taken into hospital for medical care .
up to now only a v@@ ague game description is available .

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ id@@ hausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich sees his successor at half a place in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the field of the field years ago Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completing her professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice earlier this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ bau@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover were followed by several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the new boss will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon works Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both intern@@ ships , want to settle themselves as a house @-@ atri@@ cian .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the modification , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ up EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the gar@@ bage as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises joint @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2,000 patients come into practice for each quarter in the field breaks , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house arz@@ t@@ praxis .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers talk @-@ hour , by the way , also continues to look in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the Fel@@ lowship Building .
with their par@@ ting ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen sch@@ mun@@ zel@@ nd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little mel@@ anch@@ oly makes her feel already after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia Ap@@ ples &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia rather will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to address its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already been tried in the night hours of Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country reck@@ oned with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to take people on certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ located route for ob@@ servers already predicted to shift the current Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners are consistently demonstrating a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing HOR@@ GOS , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings HOR@@ GOS and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local inst@@ al@@ ment in HOR@@ GOS : he maintains the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian Refu@@ ge@@ es have already begun distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there is still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , which has been accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exploited information should have been made insi@@ der on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were made to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tra@@ pped &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the SE@@ C release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offen@@ ders should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim for 20 years
around the Mann@@ heimer parking place there is a lively operation .
people complete their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable walking .
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
urban rail@@ ways hold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid made this action aware of its 20 year anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the representative of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteer employees .
while a pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously takes up the chal@@ k and affir@@ m the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; we can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the edge of small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ak@@ on@@ isches Werk Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which , together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , is the bear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the boards , however , is understand@@ able , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and dying was still ha@@ iry with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open themselves .
an assessment made by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the death and fun@@ eral companion is one of the hon@@ orary members of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was sought by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and was involved in the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can deal well with her task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ te , hold it for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and super@@ visions of the death and fun@@ eral accompan@@ ists .
every two years training for new employees is offered .
the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there may also be other personal wishes on post@@ cards .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lo@@ wered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ ship service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and € 10,90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ctions .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect , despite the price increases , will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for road transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November onwards .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achiev@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday occupation were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to hire between 90@@ .000 and 9@@ 5,000 additional labour forces , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to EUR 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the market trading , about one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time to stand for the first time for almost a decade .
above them at an end of the ench@@ anted , two @-@ story sitting hall , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ amper@@ ed by the unprecedented incen@@ tive by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the pre @-@ sigh@@ ted F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ously to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and whether it is only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is unsure about itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an interest of interest this week .
however , financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far from .
on Tuesday the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage value rang at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they did not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest raise would cal@@ m@@ ble the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , where the Do@@ w is now around 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events had not occurred on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US National Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dissolved confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial markets , which apparently does not seem to be linked to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , un@@ authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to an interest raise , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their glu@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts revers@@ ed .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she fears a interest in interest because the markets are ex@@ iting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at a proper school .
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation Spr@@ S tries to clarify women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects women in fact affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new &quot; ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle &quot;
the municipal council Bern@@ ried appro@@ ves the building application for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously backed up without great discussions .
among other things , among other things , the committee had submitted an application for a statutory exemp@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form for roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of the planning is to use the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof til@@ t , which is to be prescribed for energy reasons - is different from the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan had no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the slope - whereby the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der municipal council is generally rather restri@@ ctive with liber@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project for turn@@ table construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is presented to the Land@@ rat@@ samt to the test .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confir@@ ming the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , then all of the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with f@@ isher and the far@@ ther inside station .
the rooms are available .
employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Weil@@ heim , so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Joch@@ ner &apos;s white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead as of October 1 , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current rehabilitation is completed at the hospital Weil@@ heim .
Land@@ rä@@ tin Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , stood contrary to rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum web@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I excl@@ ude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner &apos;s white could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi rel@@ ocation to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , which has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old det@@ ained also on the Tuesday evening , who indeed conf@@ essed the stat@@ ute and the investig@@ ator led to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first met personal belong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old came to an end .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the police ques@@ tioning , the arrest was reported to the authorities , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be held on Wednesday the cust@@ odi@@ an , the investig@@ ators put him dead on him .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution matches on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent in the last year .

Germany sho@@ ots a deficit of housing that grows bigger from year to year .
currently , around 7@@ 0,000 residential units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the built @-@ in on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a rest@@ art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incen@@ tives should boost the social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the tax income tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats could be limited .
in addition , attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance .
the Förder@@ programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W already works well in cities and communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start of the Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the project could even be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia do a cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , practically no passing is more , there are more and more refugees the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb termin@@ ates passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian minister , and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the sh@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia to get to Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day make excessive asylum procedures in Hungary su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yug@@ oslav civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 366 people attacked .
shortly before closing on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian La@@ ws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as a criminal off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convi@@ cted thre@@ aten to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authorities , there were 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the exhibitors are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been more than 40 refugees .
however , virtually no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they collected the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barrier gr@@ ille were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
at the end of this conversion nobody wanted to speak .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria has only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy at the gig on Sunday , when there were suddenly ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wern@@ stein mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the bor@@ dered together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the near Pass@@ au .
prior to that , we had first wi@@ ped the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be handed over to a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in Wels on Sunday evening in Wels , in order to find it after the short @-@ term successful announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try over the border .
the regional train was removed from the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ party association with the Bavarian neighbors closed on Sunday , Sunday before a brid@@ ging race - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending other tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially opened up the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism .
the suff@@ erer of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oultry will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protection @-@ seeking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad looking for 35,@@ 000 winter@@ proof quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with refugee support .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to having his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place neighbor@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first recording center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken hold of Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meister@@ leistung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad is expecting a total of 85@@ .000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodations have to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create neighbour@@ hoods even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum Co@@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful in placing accommodation , Konrad explains with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one cannot say without further into the face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cost the Republic any cost as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
so far , our own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ suche has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because the suffer@@ ers are currently working without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism is carried out by the City of Directors on the division of the refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has acted on Monday for further action in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special deals with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the search @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for increased solidarity in refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria has once again controls inspec@@ tions in its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on to acquire them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
in fact Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now has gain in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories will cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought long if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large space Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten br@@ ushing from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration is not able to answer the expert with last security .
maybe it is because a nice bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called gi@@ ver .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , rep@@ utable journalists or reve@@ aling knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office swi@@ ft@@ ly stimul@@ ates the election campaign .
and cuts off well with it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , including Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , is also spoken in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long term failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once dep@@ orted without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ ric History and Folk @-@ Dog@@ s , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrary to the remarks of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the p@@ added , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bur@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landlord Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were in the USA at the time of his grand@@ father , would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ho@@ chter Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12,@@ 000 children , even in the United States arous@@ ed interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dör@@ fer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared with today 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August Today posted an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 went down .
until now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on the New Zealand coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 am - 5 : 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e sur@@ vey@@ ed 4@@ 46@@ .000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ .000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour reached 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret unveil@@ ed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unk@@ now@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be reve@@ aling whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we check with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two are checked , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the finale on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted in the ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become per@@ pen@@ sive , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were fairly compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condi@@ tionally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost an angel as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Kon@@ verti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Hay@@ ne also made public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agram .

Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ v@@ anger required more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are br@@ anded nation@@ wide standardized standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria postpon@@ es , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; with which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years is tested - in the result it will take nine years to the finish .
but Ai@@ w@@ anger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber sho@@ ots on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber sho@@ ots in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Inves@@ tig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before returning to rubber sho@@ vel .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber sho@@ ot@@ ers used , known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western part of Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature voted this week by certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be re@@ build again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
there is a mix of trade , commerce and living - concrete offers are not yet available .
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you were waiting for appropriate offers , it is called the city .
which investor question comes , is not yet clear .
no agreements have been concluded accordingly .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located on the ring road / corner of Große Straße , already purchased a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plant@@ ations for the cottage settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first presented publicly plans for the project .
some residents are more worried - they fear exp@@ atri@@ ation of their leisure time
months for months has been negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new cottage settlement at the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized company Em@@ den Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s Committee of Urban Development .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends approached the offensive from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
veh@@ ement reactions among sea bu@@ ck@@ land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads have to come so that that counts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are of the former taver@@ n is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to bring 11 million $ to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have ro@@ uted the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / surplus to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ ric tu@@ b@@ ation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes completely dissolved only in one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger decl@@ ines in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start losing weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a subject that is currently increasingly observ@@ able in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot receive all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the non@@ violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age have been reported to report po@@ ison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children , few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer within reach of children , and when children get there , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ las@@ hes from after straw@@ berry te@@ amm@@ ate inf@@ ectious agent in school , was taken into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency physician , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ ame her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors guar@@ ded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store suspension dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities via alcohol poison@@ ing .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lo@@ wing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities assume that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State New York planned to det@@ ox their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been easily injured during a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and was too late that two prec@@ urs@@ ors had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he pushed himself into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck into the rear of an audit , and whether this car was on a Ford Fi@@ esta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident @-@ involved vehicles , property damage was about 10 000 euros , the police inform@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer available and had to be to@@ wed .

HE@@ AR@@ TS will fight S@@ FA for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and war@@ bur@@ ton should be cau@@ tious during January new commitments that could destroy the unit of the cad@@ re
D@@ ons raise lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mony
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ aneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for confront@@ ation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football d@@ bor@@ ed Nieder@@ länder - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ spieler and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will spin things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss swe@@ ars to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now stands at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious during January @-@ transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks suggest@@ ing that he ha@@ sten@@ ed several January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing up and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary gam@@ ers to what you really need .

the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ erson was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Def@@ ender was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity ques@@ tioned , I have no comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le

the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certainly to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Executive Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is , however , that the decline must end on the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es rejo@@ ices to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amed that his crew from Aber@@ de@@ en had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , play in Po@@ cal@@ games or Li@@ es , the games of this type have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the period May to July unemployment remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the U@@ Ks , as shown by the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ .000 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ es with the procedure

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , there is a fl@@ aw@@ less lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will be able to watch it emoti@@ on@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone lines and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
she dre@@ amed that &quot; it would have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters you can contact for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to deter the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a peaceful quar@@ ry incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 cou@@ sins took his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid a stop of alcohol and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sample in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like to high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go around the main thing , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves into their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ die , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L behave appropri@@ ately and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now re@@ thinking about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee &apos;s Fru@@ strations have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ beaten master Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the hor@@ sem@@ an , which over@@ threw the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man was arrested after the driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helic@@ opter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beat against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring@@ struggles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely envel@@ oping reference to the Storm @-@ Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ m of his team and said they were concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , because they were worried that they were worried to be struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ ing as she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing to our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this always emerg@@ es at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm of Roo@@ sters played a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night in the final round in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200@@ ,000 $ deposit to drug policy
a man who probably threat@@ ens a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was sm@@ ug@@ gled in Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200@@ ,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ el@@ ong@@ ated punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been of a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a complaint , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200@@ ,000 dollars in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the stat@@ ely declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accident on A5 with Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had brakes in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident maker ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord locked up completely over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a p@@ est oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g took the phone of the girl when this was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of continuous pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hog@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for search for un@@ decent images of children .
Hog@@ g then said to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; p@@ est oph@@ iles on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addi@@ ction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , however , said it was done because he wanted to asser@@ t a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ or and on we@@ eping .
she then also saw the invisible pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to talk with girls who looked much younger than he .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the appeal of the Prosec@@ ution to have in@@ consistent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g will not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; may be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct until October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was given security in this case , but was kept in cust@@ ody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted before the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany for small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the large @-@ border control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many h@@ aul@@ ers left for fear of discovery and arrest the people multip@@ ly in smaller mar@@ ginal transi@@ tions
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot via bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich main railway station , there were clearly more refugees again in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 am alone , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of checks on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : bo@@ gie of Trop@@ enst@@ urm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the bo@@ gie of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in the past days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ reis with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 km per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ ways show their new products at the I@@ AA .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations fell to this segment in August alone , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are among the first .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a empha@@ si@@ zing sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , it is also available as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Ab@@ leger wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the I@@ AA .
outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented their first hand at the front part : here the radi@@ ator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a tou@@ ch@@ screen and integrated Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , the I@@ AA in the compact class joined a series of rev@@ amps and new variants , such as the Mercedes A Class or Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the judicial authority called Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope for the judges even if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , was transferred to a larger cell .
his office charges due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for the re @-@ audit .
they see the human dignity of the man viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention were author@@ it@@ ative for compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of the compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Jud@@ ges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they were only talking to a prisoner in April because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in@@ stituted a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was held every day between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines for lack of personnel over the past few weeks .
for this reason , prisoners are always included 23 hours of aggression , and the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even for h@@ unters it is said to have come about because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 shall be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees following forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings have to be created every year , and the Federal Government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in agreement , scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there is also more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was previously a prohibition of employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the short@@ age of skilled workers - there is a majority of the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few managed parents put their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ailed parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diagra@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration spreads leaf@@ lets in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - for example by allowing more training schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared for lessons without German language skills .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no short@@ age in them , says Beate St@@ offen@@ von der Berliner Schul@@ verwaltung .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or patient studying - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( C@@ DU ) has now given up his stance .
student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter usually do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they do not fall under the circle of the affected persons .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ened this Spanish course to 15 months .
however , this funding gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ um@@ b to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
duties also belong to the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and an anti @-@ discrimination law since a decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention must become reality in the coming years , when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all applicants equal to the registration of health cards .
the services rendered could later be reck@@ oned with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law prev@@ ails .
otherwise , the doctors above all make the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are educated worse about their illnesses as other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , they demand .
many refugees have been helped with more general medical conditions in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in refugee children , there are much more un@@ affected disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partial other disease pictures German doctors come from their education , but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ites or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the short@@ age of doctors , the refugees may possibly even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly need further ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee sk@@ ind is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder suff@@ ers from among other things to so @-@ called fl@@ ash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ ps and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms become chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social centres , Sach@@ be@@ arbeiter or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
MANNEQUINS invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst loads into the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ bub@@ bles to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the actual stage presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for spiritu@@ alisation lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo will take up loose .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
except through numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balance the unic@@ ycle on a sphere ?
for He yuan no problem .
so@@ ber people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; st@@ resses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are often the subject of various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes of every desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the top@@ most Command@@ ment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to your ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 am and 8 pm .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal show is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest guide , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also backed by claims of members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with be@@ hr@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she war@@ ns the Parliament &apos;s members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split up in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will make a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously unt@@ apped , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it grants a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to address traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot already play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone not well cur@@ ated .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developing an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different species of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er le@@ ague clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with k@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to allow a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are coming forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has with@@ drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms revealed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the Schön@@ e bei Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality who sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ cken in cozy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold themselves to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone past@@ oral care , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed have really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term enforcement mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends into a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the total 236 episo@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG @-@ player who brought the French master on the way , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k in the group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ k was referred to as the man who took the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ anded a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG itself sometimes arose , with some fl@@ aws and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shot , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result down before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish le@@ ague that did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great play of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore colle@@ cts 2.5 billion $ by stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by one @-@ or @-@ one commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and dis@@ astro@@ us on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Glen@@ cor@@ es share in trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened up to 0.0@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced the 2.5 billion dollar stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand US @-@ Chinese collaboration on a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced first in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi have a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding the alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the Spanish super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion champion , four times champion le@@ ague , two times club world champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted me to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won anything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over Bayern Munich .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the be@@ ating man is working for the German record master today : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time had run with X@@ avi 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the royal class triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she will not need behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scre@@ en@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian went on .
Dam@@ on and Brown concluded the production colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove hit by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People took place for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights in the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WHITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et conden@@ ses more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nation@@ wide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour@@ ing li@@ veli@@ hood .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still weaker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entert@@ ainers , producers and media players who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sports climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ eram@@ an Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , until the final .
the last task was to climb on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Br@@ itten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and changed life , it receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by anyone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tiger .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the Twin@@ s w@@ asted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vict@@ ories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first hit since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he w@@ illed the be@@ ech well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks finished a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ änder Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who designed a Two @-@ Run Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion Run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was this in the major le@@ ague for the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play .
after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , wall a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed stab@@ le@@ man stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth time .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even mo@@ vable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month due to a hin@@ d@@ rance .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily suspended there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 had arrived in H@@ esse for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have arranged emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ l : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , I was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive extension of international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
also Germany has not sent refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said there have already been talks between the General Manager for Public Safety and Ag@@ ents of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call her and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for the next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ line and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also conf@@ ess them .
but those who have no perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees meanwhile stuck on the can@@ yon route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ gs seeking ev@@ asi@@ ve routes across Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .

so the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its way around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is only small but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn , the water vap@@ or and iron particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

first com@@ bo @-@ tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ese side of the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws partly with storm strength through the con@@ cili@@ atory valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow .
on the side of the Alps there is a break in the night on Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blo@@ ws up on Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ ary valleys with bu@@ ds of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally also with more than 100 km / h in the Ur@@ ner@@ land .
the öh@@ n can penet@@ rate to the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even Or@@ kan@@ i@@ xes of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the North on Wednesday , F@@ öh@@ n burst into summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here ra@@ ins the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected to south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , depending on the amount of rain in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the air emerg@@ es , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly thunder@@ ous rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind blo@@ ws strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded of the fact that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith over centuries .
in the symbolic way , the place will be seen in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city then as a comm@@ anding sin be@@ ak .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions might have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther Firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clar@@ ke Firm of the Year for Employment Fresh@@ fields Bru@@ ck@@ haus Der@@ inger Firm of the Year for Insurance
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles which focus on topics such as Kreuz@@ weg , Pl@@ agues , Command@@ ments or Fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 year old will allow double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant mon@@ astic order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education was already with the pipe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art more important in the quick@@ est way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is shaped today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the observer come into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art had been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ end the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a painting Bible was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ hler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn nearby
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured land@@ fill , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway .
thus hill bev@@ elled , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the first municipal expert Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga a clear sign on the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle that nothing goes on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the law office and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial turn@@ out must be the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German So@@ ccer League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they are carried out on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel ( Her@@ mes ) , instead of the usual sponsor @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; we help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ manager Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama @-@ drama goes every one , nobody should be able to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football players , no , we have to use our radi@@ osity , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : CEO of SAP loses an eye on accident
the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the accident occurred on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , impot@@ ent , then went out into the streets - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board Meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour @-@ capable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wheat f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback issued by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ az against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk @-@ elf on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the por@@ ter position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Stamm@@ keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if a turn@@ table is used in all Europe le@@ ague games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , he considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for tra@@ ce@@ able : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pione@@ ering role in Germany
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Auto Show I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and provide less stress , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
among other things , the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a swi@@ ft transformation to digital radio .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are gro@@ unded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use internationally for example that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which previously only sees the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .

in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .

B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , Düssel@@ dorfer wants to strike only one single one on the cover of the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision is scheduled to fall by 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ strainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long term agreed sponsor@@ ship event in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer as a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo was also ste@@ aling , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world @-@ tran@@ spon@@ ding @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed its beginnings to a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition so@@ unded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , which was used for a lot of effort : to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
14 tons of material have sli@@ pped the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tiers of old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashionable obe@@ dience of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in a large quantity for customers who used them for example to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace mode , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien , together with nine other companies .
only they must carry the protected label .

our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , the export , current to Russia and the USA is also weak@@ ened .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points of environmental awareness , like Cord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ balance the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies who have to think economically above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine cho@@ oses small kitchens at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ piece Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße inspired himself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also returns to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want to have a souven@@ ir of souven@@ irs .
in this way I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of continuation that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;

XI calls for opening the economy wider for the world
the economy needs to open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new spin @-@ off and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , Xi said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it points to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more openly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also l@@ ure inspec@@ tions about the powers that are transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open nation@@ ally controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also took Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury mar@@ ginal value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to consume the consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve tox@@ icity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is an appropriate working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the schemes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish are lifted from one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 percent of the cor@@ rid@@ ors may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Food@@ Watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ ish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous for the human being , which is highly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities can cause particular damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion .
according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations viol@@ ate Ann@@ al@@ ena B@@ aer@@ bock with more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covering &quot; had cited the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from paper .
last year , European @-@ wide war@@ nings against mercury in fish already counted among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
