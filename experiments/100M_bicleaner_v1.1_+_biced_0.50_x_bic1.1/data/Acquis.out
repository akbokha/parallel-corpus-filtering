- on the way inspections and inspections of cargo loading of road vehicles , trucks or containers .
customs authorities take a look at the cargo loading of a road vehicle , a truck or a container at a transit duty or on the way , so they must mem@@ ori@@ ze on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections that are used in their country , the newly created customs closures and the type of controls performed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R .
if customs closures are viol@@ ated or damaged in other cases than the cases mentioned in articles 24 and 35 , goods without violation of customs inclu@@ sions are destroyed or damaged , the instructions included in Anne@@ x TI@@ R are recorded and the protocol contained in Car@@ net TI@@ R shall remain un@@ affected .

the transit duty points of each contracting party recognize the customs closures and / or simil@@ arity signals requested by the competent authorities of the other parties .
however , they can additionally attach customs inclu@@ sions and / or proximity symbols , but they must note the newly @-@ attached customs closures and / or proximity symbols on the car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country and on the sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R .
customs authorities must remove tari@@ ff caps or remove tari@@ ff marks at a transit duty or on the go because of the wareh@@ ousing of the goods load , so they can be noted on the car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding pedi@@ gree and on the sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , the newly attached customs closures and / or proximity symbols .

if one of the customs authorities has been shown satisfactory proof that the goods listed in the commodity form of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been lost or rendered ir@@ retri@@ ev@@ ably lost or that they are missing due to their nature due to natural sw@@ ings , liberation from the usual meadow to considerable duties and taxes is granted .
on the basis of the request of a contracting party , the competent authorities of the contracting parties , which are affected by a TI@@ R transport , provide all available information for the application of Articles 39 , 40 and 41 .

this explains their consent as soon as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include any endor@@ sement or an insi@@ der &apos;s knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons subject to their sovereign power , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of the special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se the costs as long as it has been agreed beforehand .
in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the civil liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this agreement in the same way as on the nationals of the states .
any claim that the Community or State is asser@@ ted against the Organization or the Organization for damages - except for damage from a nuclear incident - arising from the implementation of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , will be governed in accordance with international law .
if the Council , after checking the relevant information submitted by the General Director , states that the organization is not in a position to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be able to refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the weight gained by the measures applied by the measures applied , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be resolved with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement , which are not included in the negotiation process or by another procedure agreed by the Organization , Community and States , on the request of a party to submit an arbit@@ ration court made up of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states design@@ ate two arbit@@ rators , the organization also design@@ ates two arbit@@ rators , and the four nominated arbitr@@ ator elect a fifth person carrying the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and States or the Organization are not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ees .
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbit@@ er has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ core countries , the contracting party of the contract and shall become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the Organization is notified that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and
II ) if the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the States consult one another on request of one of the parties to change this convention .
B ) Any changes require the consent of the Organization , Community and States .
C ) The Director General will immediately inform all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written Noti@@ fication that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Agreement remains as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable to the implementation of the provisions of the Part I as necessary .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards established in this Agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive activities for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection .
to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not assigned for a particular period of time is specified for the specified Me@@ gen for a certain period of time .
in carrying out their checks , the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community after article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of its securing measures , the Community shall use de procedures and measures of the following nature and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of received , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
( e ) procedures for evaluating accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which identifies the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet reached , into the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is in@@ stituted for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope application , the plant or process phase , in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions stated in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , thus the organization and community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ rec@@ al@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , when used in gram - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which lies over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these preventive measures , provided that the total material quantity liberated by this article in the states amounts to no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alle@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the provisions of this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken to that material .
the Community coinci@@ des with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the duties of the organisation according to this Convention , determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or am@@ ended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires the inter@@ connection between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of the total assets underlying the safegu@@ ards of this agreement in states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory by following reports and results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by common resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; Special action account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special action account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is governed by the Organization as a ste@@ ward and is used only for the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the Member State which , upon request in the currency of the respective State , must be paid in order of the organization as administrator of the special ac@@ tional account and to be deposited at the depos@@ iting point of the organization in the relevant country .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the ste@@ ward agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the dates mentioned above .
according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional draws on the cash or notes of the school in order to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction bank in an appropriate manner .
in granting such loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions :
III ) the scope in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent bor@@ rowing capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) The scope in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction institution is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral qualification ) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply for the development credits financed from ordinary funds of the organization .
the funds of the special action account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force .
aside from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms which are generally applicable to the organization granted to the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years each in ten years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this time@@ piece are to be made immediately to the organisation it reserves .
each special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is stated in particular .
income from any special transaction institution may be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or services rendered in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , may be recipient of a special transaction loan .
re@@ payments made by a special transaction institution are made to the special transaction bank account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until complete awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of the payment of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this .
the Administrator tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the special transaction loans , the E@@ EC ba@@ ili@@ ff tran@@ sm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction , the amounts to be financed from the account titles , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to do this , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special action account from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the status of the special action account , the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special transaction outlets and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the Organisation could possibly agree , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total capital amount of all paid debts incurred by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect will be termin@@ ated .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States are notified by the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the or@@ derly approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned Noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding equal to equal .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; following Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty .
Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work is carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement aims to enable each contracting party to benefit from unnecessary overl@@ apping and thus the common objective of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electric power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the target of the present agreement , the parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it will be extended or am@@ ended after testing by the organs mentioned in article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the contracting parties adopt a new program , this program will take the place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II of the present agreement .
the association is realized in paragraph 1 by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties involved during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present Agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom Programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the parties include an association agreement , called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchanges , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint company J@@ ET with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , its statutes are accepted .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become contractual partners of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement , in particular , fores@@ ees the setting up of a Ste@@ ering Committee , including the representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , takes the responsibility of all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and focuses its T * in the interests of the two parties to the common goal established in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme as well as on the common goal established in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek .
the Advisory Groups , which submit the VG research proposals to the extent that the funds approved for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with respect to all research and development works referred to in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved .
the Committee of Directors , which has to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out during the programme , are fully utili@@ sed for all research and development projects that fall under the present agreement .
he is particularly concerned with the best possible use of personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordination committees used within the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordination committees , which provide suitable proposals for the best possible use of funds , personnel , and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country for nuclear and energy research .
on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing the future programmes and setting up its total scope , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of merger .
the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the coordination committees have an advisory capacity .
the statement of the VG to the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel inter@@ change .
the representatives of the two parties involved work on the works of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount held in the same proportion to the share of the Eur@@ atom programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme as the gross domestic product of the Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established .
moreover , Switzerland re@@ jects J@@ ET to the Common Market , which is to be defined in accordance with the rules of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Company .
the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom makes for the financing of work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel transfer is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom posts to finance the work performed on the basis of the corresponding treaties .
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amounts to cover the expenditure in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the current year .
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before 15 .
July . the other payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in Anne@@ x III of the present agreement .
Switzerland takes all necessary measures to make Eur@@ atom free of duties or other donations , as well as import ban and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which shall be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement .
in Switzerland , the items acquired or acquired there may not be disposed of either un@@ paid or free of charge in this country unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves the conditions that the Federal Council appro@@ ves .
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to lef@@ to@@ vers and pensions , which are paid to these individuals .
the provisions on access to the knowledge stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement are governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on the Person@@ nel Exchange .
the provisions on access to the knowledge applicable to Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Joint Company J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Common Company .
the right of each contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
- the exchange of personnel under the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and third countries ;
- adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the third countries involved in awar@@ ding contracts for the implementation of the two associated programs according to the principle of the best exploitation of the amounts used .
the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be shared with the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom .
the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland is communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the affiliated third countries as well as to the persons or companies that operate in a member state of Eur@@ atom or an associated third @-@ country research or production activities , which justify access to these knowledge .
the parties share this knowledge in other countries , persons or companies only if a treaty is agreed between the parties unless these persons or companies operate in Switzerland research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge .
if the knowledge acquired under Section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents can be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the third countries and the persons or companies that are located in the affected countries for research purposes in pursuit of the goals of this agreement .

the agreements could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future supply funds of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which application the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw should not be made before the end of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking account of the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied by the BI@@ S at the time in under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S must supply the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market developments that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community finds provisions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the sale of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lam@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of world trade with these products .

I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining rate 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining rate 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
under this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is bound to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement refer to each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the board under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community particip@@ ates in the protection clause , it is committed to ensuring that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the common market is not affected by this agreement .
if Uruguay &apos;s imports exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community ple@@ dges to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products collected from this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount prescribed under number 2 corresponding to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trading with every new Member State .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um@@ di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for an ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ aging and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood type determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents to determine the blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the determination of blood type determination , for which International standard preparations exist ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 @-@ 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparative ti@@ re@@ ation of the standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the feasibility trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 percent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ oric pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents determined for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as there is no international agreement on a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
every single container is a black printed label printed in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
