<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days following the entry into force; an extension of this period requires the interconnection between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report named in Article 62, the organization provides a summarized inventory of the total assets underlying the safeguards of this agreement in states, regardless of its origin, and continues this inventory by following reports and results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by common resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the purpose of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bindings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization directs a special account under the name "Special action account," which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special action account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is governed by the Organization as a steward and is used only for the purpose specified in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the Member State which, upon request in the currency of the respective State, must be paid in order of the organization as administrator of the special actional account and to be deposited at the depositing point of the organization in the relevant country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the entry within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the steward agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time between the EEC and the caretaker taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may wish to make payments before the dates mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedure of the organization, the caretaker takes approximately proportional draws on the cash or notes of the school in order to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction bank in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting such loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the scope in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its subsequent borrowing capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) The scope in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction institution is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project (including a sectoral qualification) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that apply for the development credits financed from ordinary funds of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special action account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organisation, which is tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Aside from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms which are generally applicable to the organization granted to the organization; they are therefore refundable in 50 years each in ten years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this timepiece are to be made immediately to the organisation it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Income from any special transaction institution may be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or services rendered in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted, may be recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Repayments made by a special transaction institution are made to the special transaction bank account, and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until complete awarding of all the special transaction loans, the caretaker will instruct the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the payment of the special transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loans, the EEC bailiff transmits a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and executes appropriate records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction, the amounts to be financed from the account titles, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To do this, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full issue of the means of the special action account from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the status of the special action account, the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special transaction outlets and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organisation could possibly agree, the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all paid debts incurred by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is repaid and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural regulations of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are notified by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned.</seg>
