this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. agit@@ ated thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where the patient altern@@ ates man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ak high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to take or the fusion tablets can be applied in patients to whom the swal@@ lowing of tablets causes difficulties .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing them from occurring .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the onset of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , suffering from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by increased un@@ rest , with the study of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the fusion tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented more effective than placebo for recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than placebo and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders , tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headaches , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , nau@@ sea ( elevated sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
given the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after replacement of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive pulmon@@ ary disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including accentu@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or stop the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , need to be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in situations related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ urine , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sor metaboli@@ zers .
if one considers the common gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected to increase with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ oses / 3 @-@ Metho@@ d@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ oses ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animals , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined following the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , a total lower incidence of 25.@@ 8 % ( 25.@@ 8 % ) was compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , as well as the occurrence associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional hyper@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated dos@@ ages of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ I receptor , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ test showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients maintaining a response to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a versus placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a versus placebo presented efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presented himself with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l with extensive metaboli@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in the case of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well with a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose of patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages leading to exposure to 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected to increase with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean average dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages leading to exposure to 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle in circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the pharmaceuticals already used for maintenance or ac@@ ut treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy processed tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive pulmon@@ ary disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including accentu@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ urine , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) was used as one @-@ time indication intra@@ muscular and the simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l &apos;s sole gift .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined following the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with aria cycl@@ one treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , as well as the occurrence associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement of the bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients maintaining a response to the study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rate @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients reported weight gain of at least 7 % versus the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presented himself with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration after repeated administration ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 @-@ or 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application did not reveal any safety @-@ related concerns about mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
rab@@ bits were observed following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel chemotherapy .
considering only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference in drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other breast cancer treatments showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low blood levels in the blood or before the treatment commen@@ ces .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel chemotherapy and that unlike other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medication , it has to be given not to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ spinal count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendations of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ spinal count has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et count again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease .
if the patients suffer from nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating remedies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to have no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect transport and ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ depend@@ ant ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , chest pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness very often :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ sc@@ opic substance that promotes the composition of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ lu@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ se@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ arm non @-@ linked studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. per m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ az@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching extra @-@ vascular distribution and / or soft @-@ linking of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ arances .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , care should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ perme@@ ate bottle .
after completing the solution , the drive bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure good moist@@ ening of solids .
then the cup should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ p@@ board of the powder is carried out .
if any precip@@ itation or sin@@ uses are visible , the water bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to the application .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market prior to market launch provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Educational brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ y@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood don@@ or is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood don@@ or , Ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an@@ thropo@@ i@@ tic deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference medicinal product in a study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ y@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of sever@@ ed Ab@@ y@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ y@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ y@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ y@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ y@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , proof was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across the Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medi@@ c@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a approval for the placing of Ab@@ y@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned greater surgical procedures requiring large blood volume ener@@ vation ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of third blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults without iron deficiency , where high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed by a patient or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to check the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cu@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ count for ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ y@@ amed should receive 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Ab@@ y@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who develop with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ y@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
patients who are eligible for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program is the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or cereb@@ ral disease ; in patients with recently received heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of active effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ escence , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the rel@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , considering an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA are considered .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ y@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events was observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to epo@@ et@@ ines , if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical signs of coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa predic@@ ts a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo major elec@@ tive surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial average value of &gt; 13 g / dl there may be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mb@@ al / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
via th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm , ret@@ ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , also reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ angi@@ ogen@@ ous events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ties .
independent of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the aid of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ us ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - Lymph@@ omas ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 mam@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 Bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ us .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a significantly higher mortality rate compared to the controls because of different malign@@ ancy of malign@@ ancy .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was not increased .
14 in animal experiments with approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose recommended in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fö@@ tal body weight , dela@@ ying the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and introduced in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and functional before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in traffic .
the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market comm@@ its itself to the studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application as well as subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management System for Human Use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • obtaining new information that may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones • after invitation by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from an unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) has occurred , for example , if such a drop of blood has occurred .
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in blood plat@@ el@@ et numbers may occur within the normal range , which is reg@@ ression during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ y@@ amed prior to treatment .
very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie , it will break your treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection in a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in raises the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or disease signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ em@@ o@@ emia in adults with chronic ren@@ al failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ y@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ y@@ amed dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in case you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed will act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed should investigate the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment and treat it accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ y@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have / to take other medicine or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor will be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ y@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , strokes , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular for@@ ts ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ ce ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation , and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using Ab@@ y@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can result in a blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed .
treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood sample formation after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your starting point is too high

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion , or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ ro@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was to norm@@ alize the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ ro@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ ro@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , Ac@@ ro@@ sta &apos;s patients suffer from the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ ro@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a licence to transport Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ ro@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient calcium intake , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s application .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.4 ) Pati@@ ents with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) are not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ ro@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , since data is lacking in safety and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta before beginning treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient calcium intake , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered prior to the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive tooth treatment .
for patients need@@ ing dental surgery , no data is available to reduce the risk of bone @-@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s application ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al impair@@ ment is associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ ro@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values that were below the normal range of fluctu@@ ation ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , over oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zinc cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other mental intervention .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area of one patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an equilibrium may be achieved with the administration of oral calcium and / or an IV in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ score for the S@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ ged body fra@@ ctions Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a decreased risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the lower th@@ ig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic tract were taken .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline level to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ale was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study , the Ac@@ ro@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment at all time points .
in comparison to placebo , the Ac@@ ro@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall level and 4.3 % on the lower row than the placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ ro@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , predominantly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ ro@@ sta and Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month study were eligible for a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ ate in a mean follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimin@@ atory phase with a termin@@ ale elimin@@ atory period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned 1 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , whereas the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentrations by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min at the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
as for severe ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and weighed 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in mice .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) have been given equal to 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats by 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all doses , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity at dos@@ ages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured in a way that makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta acts to norm@@ alize the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forces the bones .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and beverages , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
because Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long @-@ term effect , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in the time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ ro@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if missed the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . if you are considering ending treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms in yourself after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .
in patients with a recently recovered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended that Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion takes two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients undergoing di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

am@@ compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
in addition , four trials of more than 7@@ ,000 patients were carried out in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to adjust smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , studies on the attitudes of smoking showed no consistent results so that the effect of am@@ compli@@ a in this application area was difficult to assess .
which risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the trials ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause suicide in a small minority of patients .
caution is required when using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who - besides obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice when these symptoms appear .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not shown .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained with the start of the account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapie was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered at dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients taking placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available to use pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. a previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is applied in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be controlled again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ resolved nausea , vomiting , upper belly pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported in the treatment with thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report ab@@ norm@@ alities of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ational medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ational medicine .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduces the insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not appreciated from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege performed beyond thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the standard range , albeit less frequently than in placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ isons of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medications .
in the Pro@@ Active trial lasting over a period of 3.5 years , questionna@@ ires were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ational medicine .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone seems to work on activating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who still received insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study on Type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ dog@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ zes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimin@@ atory period of unchanged Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metaboli@@ tes is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded with repeated administration of plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the Hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting from the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ por@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ational medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ational medicine .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined each with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ dog@@ dial heigh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ale , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular high @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and of more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women showed .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to effectively use the insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighing the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a approval for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the integration of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change concerning strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against is@@ lan@@ din origin ) may cause a change in the dose required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore needs to take into account the possible interactions in the therapy and always ask its patients for other medications taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a poorly controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ to@@ d in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with ail@@ ments referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar level may , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the lower skin tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise if neglected to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
general disorders and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma on the injection site ) may occur .
disorders of the immune system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / unconscious .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics therefore should always have grape sugar , candy , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an experienced person or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the work is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by split@@ ting is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the integration of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin acting quickly must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin acting .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystal de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ oth no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine @-@ crystalline deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic use other medicines at least during the first six months under treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients taking aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day took 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once took 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including one from medical history known or currently present ) and / or arthritis .
if the ser@@ oton@@ in acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
transplan@@ t recipients As there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , acute arthritis can occur during the course of treatment , because the lowering of the serum resin cone will initially mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it has to be deposited in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials , minor ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure treatment and in the course of subsequent clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll len@@ ght ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study involving test subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not be related to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ eral disease and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * No severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed in the clinical trials .
7 Open @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of breath , skin disc@@ ol@@ or@@ ations , skin les@@ ions , erectile dysfunction , increase of potassium concentration in the blood , increase of TS@@ H concentrations in the blood , decline in lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the mechanism of action ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises in the course of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing located below nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic an@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month fixed serum levels of ser@@ ums were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum supple@@ mentation at the beginning of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum levels of &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x per day ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheum@@ atic cases , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atic de@@ formation ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ite , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the rheum@@ atic no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , greater than the dose proportional increase .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at only ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , pain of the locom@@ otor system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) and aci@@ dic u@@ pro@@ oting .
for patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it should not be used in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , are given only in particular caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be advised to consult the medicine when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn .
3 The risk of serious adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rare ( after market introduction ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy contains primarily intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a jaw @-@ surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is author@@ it@@ ative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised to take the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8,0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups showed similar frequency .
due to an oral over@@ dose , hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract can occur such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was detected in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ user .
compared to placebo , in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.3 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % vs. placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution Studies of rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively tagged substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the folds .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that humans are affected by the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter further studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated , such as Adv@@ agra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other constitu@@ ents , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious if other ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the same drug taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ arded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the pale yellow capsule upper part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; Ma 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below ) .
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as Tal@@ mud , was comparable to both nod@@ ular and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral intake of medicines during the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Shift from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t receptor of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , so this switch has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must commen@@ ce for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to an@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ y@@ on@@ - , p@@ ank@@ le and color@@ ectal patients , found Pro@@ gra@@ f in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood cell level in the targeted area may be required for patients with severe liver function disorders to reduce the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels , a calculation of the atine content and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mud @-@ controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talent during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ mud of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or concur@@ rent use of substances which may alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the Tal@@ mud level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mud of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the retard@@ ated formulation of adv@@ agra@@ ph are still available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ arded wor@@ ding Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was known as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy treated aqu@@ a or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ ruption are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , retard@@ ants , lac@@ tose , special caution is given in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with the simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolic metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus action on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of examinations in transplan@@ t patients do not provide a clu@@ e that compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy consists .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ka@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the co @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant medication is often not exactly observed because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of B@@ Cs @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ om@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules used twice daily after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts .
175 patients transplan@@ ted to 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and used in 6@@ 30 cases following an intestinal transplan@@ t as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .

the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients , who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ized trial tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
micro@@ kerat@@ opla@@ sty The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of Factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ents are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enabled it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients suffering from severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a 53 children study under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ a in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new ble@@ mis@@ hes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side @-@ effects of lawyers ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period of time .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , and the risk depends on genetic and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ positions .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low@@ - tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A among women there are no experiences about the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate again showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward tendency as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the presence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ us gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE was reported to have hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

special caution when using A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE is necessary you should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms may present early signs of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic sho@@ cks , which may additionally include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you are taking other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
your doctor will calculate your dose A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( in international units or I.@@ E. ) , depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding .
patients who develop factor VI@@ II inhibit@@ ors If the expected factor VI@@ II mirrors in your plasma can not be reached with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE or the bleeding cannot be controlled , this could contribute to the development of factor VI@@ II@@ -
in connection with surgery cath@@ eter infections , lower number of red blood cells , swelling of limbs and joints , prolonged bleeding after removal of drainage , decreased factor VI@@ II mirror and postoperative ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE security profile , which makes P@@ SU@@ R@@ s submission every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in five years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the un@@ broken p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the under@@ body , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers from the company to the questions asked to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ women men@@ i @-@ tumors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ preh@@ ensive @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents under 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in the eyes of all hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against neur@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a lack of intra@@ ocular pressure , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , it should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease during long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks following the completion of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ gol@@ ep@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be performed per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as a loss of rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ acet@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ol@@ az@@ oline etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient &apos;s collective and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed .
patients suffering from cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ a@@ emia should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pu@@ pill@@ ary rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in an individual dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage may cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nose mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes following the administration of the plasma .
according to the Peru@@ vian application of aer@@ os@@ ols in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi @-@ dose @-@ study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous administration of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ entri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer which leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach and du@@ oden@@ um ( breathing difficulty due to a cra@@ mp of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
inform your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication , even if it is not prescription medicine .
transport and the use of machines In use at recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the given time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .
pal@@ pit@@ ations or heart rhythms , increased physical activity , redness , hot flas@@ hes , confusion , blur@@ red vision , dry eyes , nas@@ al breathing , nas@@ al irritation , nas@@ al inflammation , nas@@ al con@@ ges@@ tion , pain or difficulty in ur@@ ination , it@@ ching , shi@@ vering , decreased sense of smell , conspic@@ uous liver parameters , rest@@ lessness , anxiety and irrit@@ ability .
after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash have rarely been reported .
in cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspic@@ uous liver values , was also very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg @-@ fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the cu@@ cum@@ ber , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of as@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the number of symptoms ( symptom count ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies of ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms end and resum@@ ed after the onset of symptoms .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study that was administered up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the loading of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis according to the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine disease is an caus@@ ative factor in all of the caus@@ tic diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , besides chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ ms at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ los@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal aller@@ gen rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely eliminated .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support the treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se neur@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose @-@ dose of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dietary dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not increase or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous consumption of alcohol .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , con@@ flu@@ ence and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total scores of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ ms at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metaboli@@ sing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black people ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets once daily lay in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly differ from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed processed tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to form@@ ulate Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically significant clinical trial involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days was not statisti@@ cally significant .
in an individual dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this poorly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate , form@@ ulations were bio @-@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets facilitate the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 .

the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most commonly encountered side effects were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .

June 2008 announced Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s application for the prevention of behavi@@ our@@ al H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus .
the virus was then separated , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are participating in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to take in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ re@@ ase according to body weight is directed .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
however , AIDS cannot cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug used with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a virus load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment .
in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , resulted in a stronger rub@@ b@@ ish of the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded as well as am@@ eth@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase take the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risk of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was found at the time of approval for scientific grounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to bring am@@ nesty to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
gener@@ a capsules are usually to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ mus 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous injection of am@@ v@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , am@@ per@@ asis may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
for h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with inferior therapeutic lati@@ tude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ mus 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
in the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and release the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ f@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , by 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were administered twice a day in clinical trials twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in potentially lowers the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , care must be taken because Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
care must be taken when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin caused an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily resulted in an increase in C@@ MA@@ x from ket@@ on@@ avi@@ r to 2.@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may possibly interact with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with am@@ eth@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as A@@ bo@@ gen@@ ase since it may result in resor@@ ption disturbances .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
concur@@ rent as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side @-@ effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous corne@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous injection of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are notable increases in plasma levels while administ@@ ering ap@@ hor@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be administered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , aspir@@ ase may not be applied together with the oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time , caution is advisable with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for concur@@ rent application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate possible increase in plasma levels of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rite @-@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at this time , such as am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us during pregnancy .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a re@@ manufacturing study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ cking in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of po@@ sterity , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ parti@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to treatment failure .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ al fat accumulation .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral targets treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin rash was usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ose or mac@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory alterations ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory alterations ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is informed of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral go@@ os@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ esters with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ conc@@ entri@@ c concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r therapy schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not occur pre@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ M , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ P@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ P@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations of L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / F / F , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / F / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( isolation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ ent@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear to cause .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and standard of care ( SO@@ C ) were treated with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ parti@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ marine threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ parti@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested for intake and capsules 3 times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rite avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ parti@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , lowered by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made up of 14 % less bio @-@ compliant than the capsules ; therefore , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al impair@@ ment should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data to the human being , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there were little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in case of systemic plasma exposure that was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with weak or light liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
50@@ 8 % increase , by 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
care must be taken when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous corne@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ ons ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ manufacturing study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ cking in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ parti@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is informed of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ conc@@ entri@@ c concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; as@@ parti@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al impair@@ ment should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

toxic@@ ity studies that were treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in fry the metabolism paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for recording has not been used in patients treated with PI or PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dos@@ ed p@@ inion , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ lic acid , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
for h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .

based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic@@ ological reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l contained ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .

many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r therapy schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ parti@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete cure rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete cure rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream can be continued until all visible tendencies have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient must apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
spread I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub it into the puri@@ fied skin area , until the cream is completely dra@@ ined .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a consideration in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ co@@ gnition was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a disorder leading to circumc@@ ision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local irritation was observed even under the appropriate application , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applying methods for the treatment of external sei@@ zur@@ es in the genital and peri@@ anal area , no clinical experience has been present so far .
although limited data points to an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the disposal of the cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions atro@@ phy after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as no data is currently available for long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is available in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated tumors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses of anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic not@@ ch on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally take off in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data from an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treating the ti@@ lt ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include discomfort on the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme of a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection , was a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ rap@@ ing / sc@@ rap@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan indicated by the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe mold growth and reduction ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been demonstrated in the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy in the treatment of a complete healing of the inj@@ ections during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo .
in 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients cured completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing was achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week for 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external ti@@ lt , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis and super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three weeks weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml during the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the site .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk to humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumours appeared in the group of mice that were treated with the active free cr@@ ème before and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the not neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements more difficult , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be administered in a hospital or clinic with recovery devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction .

the study focused mainly on the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the integration of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with a reliable diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any associated side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should be closely monitored closely , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting , in which re@@ vit@@ alization devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase III study it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously treated after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
pre @-@ treatment 60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ g@@ ents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
adverse events in clinical trials were mostly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and in 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the Phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older have been reported in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs reported severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desired drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated within 3 months from the beginning of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a more severe follow @-@ up form usually within one month compared to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase III trial ( resp@@ . until a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) 13 / 45 patients had no det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ immuno@@ stain@@ ing ( R@@ IP ) , among them 3 patients with whom it was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the appearance of un@@ desirable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme treatment therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient re@@ constitution of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had a medium phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the placebo group to improve lung function and the ability to walk in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerges from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V was not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first four weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant up to the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year , open @-@ phase 2 study was carried out , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dose was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased levels of G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine of weeks 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ S@@ core ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe tra@@ vers@@ al form there were only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms met@@ ering schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed below .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer for cancer ) and mal@@ ign ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has spread to other parts of the body or is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a therapy for patients who have not previously been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , decreased or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy versus their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in 5@@ 71 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medication against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin alone .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparison drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in pre@@ valent plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for vast dis@@ crete layer epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration and the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) per week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood @-@ picture should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sm@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking account of the presence of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ - or - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , there was an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , dose adjustments were not necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , exceeding the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sposition of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ological count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et count again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ spinal levels , plat@@ el@@ et count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment courses ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of level 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all treated patients must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this agent was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible impair@@ ment of reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the reference guide to consult with regard to the sperm count .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or as@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women but , as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed cannot be applied during pregnancy except if it is obligatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to get advice on the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed enters the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin received as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ di@@ ums , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .

in clinical studies patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ onic ) .
in clinical studies patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial Pneum@@ onia with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients that were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points , by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ sp@@ as@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ in@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the case of the Lun@@ - gen@@ canc@@ symptom@@ at@@ ala in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ certain C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8,3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for combining A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.2 months for the combination of cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( matched HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC history on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with an overall confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ submission threshold of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin require fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transformation ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te transformation ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients needed the addition of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed after administration as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is largely ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours after application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total weight of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3,5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

dissolve the contents of the 100 mg / ml cup sy@@ ringe with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a conc@@ es@@ ration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is applied to obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot de@@ grade some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats allowed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year versus 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study of All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d@@ lab@@ eling , step pull , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , exit o@@ ily secre@@ tions , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term Mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant and nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to launch or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to a minimum , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist at the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and cephal@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained normal .
however , patients should be advised to take supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal flora and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known adverse events determined after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings occurred .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick recovery of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ati@@ cal Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be found spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plastic concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the action of the capsules , resulting in more fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the start of the treatment , as you may not have significantly reduced the fat content in your diet at that time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional @-@ related side effects : • start a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you will exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial after@@ table , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Do not store pharmaceuticals for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date specified on the car@@ ton . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ cones , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Cardi@@ ac disease • Stro@@ ke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most per day .
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you , take a look at the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s effectiveness , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat supply is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat supply , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not go down on a daily basis or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily through exercise , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat goals and to keep it up . • Sense is a nutritional diary with information about calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies which are a moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting .
in chemotherapy , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki @-@ Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the integration of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severely ill @-@ treated chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids which have been given prior to chemotherapy .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ st@@ ination or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with the simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , alo@@ xi is not to be used either for prevention or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron im@@ pe@@ des the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly related to alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is unlikely to be effective in an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ cin plus 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results of the studies of moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular death and repression and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ life time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations it emerges that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous injection in healthy eyes , the total body type was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination cycle time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular death and rep@@ lication and can pro@@ long the period of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about the 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended for the use of al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ effective component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are abnormal .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon disclosed data that corro@@ bor@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon compared to the efficacy of the reference physician was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided for the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease decreased in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ es@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected der@@ ail@@ ments , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wound , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been noted that al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( empty cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections prov@@ oked or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation on the job site .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections in case of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the launch of al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully re@@ con@@ scienti@@ ously and appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of concur@@ rent use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in people after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on sk@@ ate skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical treatment in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / ended , balance the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that were used by al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of con@@ rod mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance obtained by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partly blocking P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s @-@ Bosnian sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appears question@@ able , consultation by experts should be as@@ pi@@ red .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on shiel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 of the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 abra@@ ded skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhi@@ bit .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro analysis of gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats any indication of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times greater exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ographical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed .
the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and are described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application , as well as all additional R@@ MP updates which are agreed with the CH@@ MP .

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of a two @-@ dose antibiotic , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can end up in two doses .
if a boo@@ ster dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adult and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used for the protection against the same diseases , however , both adults and Twin@@ rix children are given children under a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult ingredients contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et Ad@@ ult were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardi@@ zation plan for basic immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ines , taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a boo@@ ster vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ inal vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and Anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and Anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ inal vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent individuals who have addressed a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a boo@@ ster vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ised hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may be reached after the immun@@ ization , so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vaccine may be necessary .
as intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eus muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal results , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ically , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tus@@ sis , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it may be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination unit Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the test subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the volunteers who had given the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ised hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vaccine trials involving serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V serum rates were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the rates of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after injection of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ ised hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units with a combined H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the mat@@ ing of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for the present formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses ( though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier ino@@ cul@@ ation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination unit ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has received / has received / has received or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast @-@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 decim@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the pick@@ up or redness • Mat@@ tness • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 decim@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects reported that days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B were very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 infected doses ) were reported :
these include locally limited or prolonged stops , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ icle @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye contours and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known for placing the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP view that the benefits risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ium is divided into several single sockets for meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ li ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nas@@ al son@@ ata ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there was no comparable study since ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ based medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste version , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , high ammon@@ ia values were effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ium was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information on this medicine was prescribed due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already manifest in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
ar@@ gin@@ ine patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be taken in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate are taken over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in pregnant women is unknown ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate power , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an occasional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of di@@ gest@@ ed sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of the ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium ben@@ zene , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ um ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and thereafter continued to be treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients another deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is converted into liver and kidneys enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable next morning after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gar@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who are not able to swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ ide or a nas@@ al son@@ ata .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) before birth , there were les@@ ions in the brain cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate power , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fluids .
on the basis of tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients another deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ules form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) before use .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , loss of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for initi@@ ation of the appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS following the exp@@ iry date stated on the car@@ ton and container according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usable up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ography or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox was - with or without a gift from G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other hi@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently , as well as for people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the treatment of AC@@ S and PCI is a acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd was approved by the European Commission for the launch of angi@@ ox in the European Union .
to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST recovery inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt release of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single angi@@ ox bol@@ us administration has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the cle@@ av@@ age dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without any dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 Pati@@ ents with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the administration of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .

patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge during treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is reached again prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters in each case are regularly checked .
the animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ group and in the treated comparison groups compared with he@@ par@@ in @-@ treated comparison groups , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined following the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ ant plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reducing the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ ali@@ zations occurred , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 are more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system categories .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ binary inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as the ani@@ onic ind@@ ent@@ ure region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible since Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , there was no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI has been conducted in the patient below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treating acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST recovery inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is unable to work effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working times than a short @-@ acting human insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot metaboli@@ se insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any other component , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced amount of glucose and the reduced insulin supply , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change in the activity of the insulin type , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in the insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates , and Sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ Antibiot@@ ics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympath@@ iz@@ ers such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ine and reser@@ pine .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin passes into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter the mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
following clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 /

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine and the duration of action is shorter than for cou@@ - man@@ t normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ li@@ age in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 L / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
it was clear from the data that a similar post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine 2 minutes before the meal , just like with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine was inherited 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was reached .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human insulin analog which is given 2 months before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and in comparison to normal insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
