<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. agitated thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where the patient alternates manic episodes (periods of anorak high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to take or the fusion tablets can be applied in patients to whom the swallowing of tablets causes difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from occurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the onset of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, suffering from increased unrest, over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over 12 weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by increased unrest, with the study of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the patient's symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the fusion tablets and the solution for inserting (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented more effective than placebo for recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased unrest than placebo and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders, tremor (tremor), headaches, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (elevated saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I-disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazl compared the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia and patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Given the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after replacement of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive pulmonary disease), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accentuated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or stop the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, need to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in situations related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazl treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurine, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensor metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common gift of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram (CYP2D6) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected to increase with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphoses / 3-Methodmorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphoses).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the lack of data on humans and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animals, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined following the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazl, a total lower incidence of 25.8% (25.8%) was compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazl and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient populations under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, as well as the occurrence associated with Aripiprazl, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch, unintended or intentional hyperdosages with Aripiprazl were observed alone in adult patients with estimated dosages of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by combining a partially agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HTI receptor, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and on the puttest showed a dose-dependent reduction in dosage of Aripiprazl in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 was the share of responder patients maintaining a response to the study medication in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% versus the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder, Aripiprazl showed a versus placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazl showed a versus placebo presented efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazl also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12 such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms that did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl presented himself with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl with extensive metabolizers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In the case of Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well with a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the Galle by monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81th of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazl found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages leading to exposure to 3 and 11 times of the mid-steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the pharmaceuticals already used for maintenance or acut treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed with extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive pulmonary disease), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accentuated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurine, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally associated with schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the single dose of Aripiprazl, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15 mg dosage) was used as one-time indication intramuscular and the simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In case of CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazl's sole gift.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials involving Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined following the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with aria cyclone treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient populations under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, as well as the occurrence associated with Aripiprazl, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with statistically significant greater improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement of the baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 was the share of responder patients maintaining a response to the study medication in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-DepressionsRate-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational dual-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients reported weight gain of at least 7% versus the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms that did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks, followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl presented himself with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies involving healthy subjects, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration after repeated administration (AUC), which was 15-or 5 times above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application did not reveal any safety-related concerns about maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3-10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the Galle by monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">Rabbits were observed following dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times of the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference in drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other breast cancer treatments showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low blood levels in the blood or before the treatment commences.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy and that unlike other paclitaxel medication, it has to be given not to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrospinal count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy level 3, treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached to degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendations of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the renal function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have considerably more pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrospinal count has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet count again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly marked cardiotoxicity was not proven with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patients suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the administration of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constipating remedies.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to have no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment because the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect transport and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependant; leukopenia was reported to 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, chest pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicroscopic substance that promotes the composition of microtubules from tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates translucytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transedothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-arm non-linked studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. per m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% because of metastazation and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume refers to a far-reaching extra-vascular distribution and / or soft-linking of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-based paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating far-reaching non-renal clearances.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light above 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, care should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane-permeate bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After completing the solution, the drive bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure good moistening of solids.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the cup should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete resuspboard of the powder is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="329">If any precipitation or sinuses are visible, the water bottle must be inverted again gently in order to achieve a complete resuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Educational brochure • Summary of the features of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging inserts.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abyamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called" "" "reference medicinal product" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, which may occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood donor is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abyamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donor, Abyamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by anthropoitic deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In a main study with 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems, Abseamed was compared to the reference medicinal product in a study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Abyamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of severed Abyamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abyamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who still received Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abyamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abyamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abyamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, proof was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across the Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a approval for the placing of Abyamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas, or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned greater surgical procedures requiring large blood volume enervation (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of third blood, Abseamed can be used before a large electro-orthopaedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, where high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed by a patient or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - sequelae may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to check the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozytencount for ≥ 40,000 cells / µl versus the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the precislocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl increased compared to baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the average dose of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozytencount increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl versus the baseline value, response to epoetin-alfa is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abyamed should receive 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Abyamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop with any erythropoetin at a erythroblastoenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive Abyamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">Patients who are eligible for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program is the application of epoetin alfa in the following pre-, escort or cerebral disease; in patients with recently received heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenie (PRCA) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of active effect, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Reticulosis value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiuminescence, infections or inflammations, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reltikulocyte value, considering anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA are considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abyamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin- target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to epoetines, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia symptoms and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical signs of coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients with chemotherapy, epoetin alfa predicts a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoieine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic intervention, if possible, prior to the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo major elective surgery should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial average value of &gt; 13 g / dl there may be an increased risk of post-operative thrombal / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Via thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retarthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys, also reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thromboangiogenous events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoieties.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically obtained epoetin alfa is glycosilized and identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be demonstrated with the aid of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoiesis and does not affect the leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a traumatic hip fracture such as falling down; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion, or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetaminopol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied for a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was to normalize the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood or decreased at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Acrosta (without any other osteoporosis medication) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fractures 9% of patients under Acrosta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zinc citric acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, Acrosta's patients suffer from the risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material for doctors who prescribe Acrosta to treat osteoporosis, which contains indications of how to apply the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include: • The pack supplement • Double indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side-effects • When referring to medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year for postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the Aclasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget Morbus, Acrosta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient calcium intake, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of acetaminopol or ibuprofen shortly after Aclasta's application.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal impairment (see Section 4.4) Patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) are not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Acrosta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age, since data is lacking in safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with aclasta before beginning treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient calcium intake, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer (chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered prior to the use of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive tooth treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental surgery, no data is available to reduce the risk of bone-phosphonate treatment in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of acetaminopol or ibuprofen shortly after Aclasta's application (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe side-effect reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal impairment is associated with renal dysfunctions associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Acrosta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium-values that were below the normal range of fluctuation (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoarthritis in the jaw area was reported, especially in cancer patients, over osteoarthritis (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonates, including zinc citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other mental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area of one patient with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, an equilibrium may be achieved with the administration of oral calcium and / or an IV infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density (BMD) -T-score for the Senkelhas ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric edged body fractions Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a decreased risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density in the lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared to placebo-treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the lower thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic tract were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP after 12 months by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the baseline level to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was held at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortale was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT-study, the Acrosta treatment increased the BMD in comparison to placebo-treatment at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison to placebo, the Acrosta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% on the overall level and 4.3% on the lower row than the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Acrosta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, predominantly light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (average serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of Riserronate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Acrosta and Riserronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as respondents at the end of the six-month study were eligible for a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Riserronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Riserronate in a mean follow-up phase of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a long eliminatory phase with a terminale eliminatory period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned 1 ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, whereas the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron concentrations by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min at the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a Kreatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal impairment (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and weighed 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in mice.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC) have been given equal to 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledron acid was administered in rats by 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all doses, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogeneity at dosages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonates, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget Morbus, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is structured in a way that makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta acts to normalize the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and reinforces the bones.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you are using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been used / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained with the start of the account treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapie was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered at dosage of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin showed a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the placing of actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available to use pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. a previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of the liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be controlled again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, upper belly pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematoglobin by 3.1-2% and hematoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported in the treatment with thiacolidindiones, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report abnormalities of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC by Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not appreciated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege performed beyond threefold of the upper limit of the standard range, albeit less frequently than in placebo, but more rarely than in comparisons of metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial lasting over a period of 3.5 years, questionnaires were performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately adjusted with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who still received insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study on Type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol level as well as slight, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while under metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglyceride level, but also improved the postdogdial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive trial, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fäzes (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma eliminatory period of unchanged Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincided with repeated administration of plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the Hyperinsulin resistance resulting from the gestation decreases and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other ThiazolidIndions led to increased frequency of colonospores.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postdogdial heightened triglyceride level, which has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortale, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular high-term risks are associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to effectively use the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly lowered as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package supplement).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane in the treatment of diabetes were outweighing the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a approval for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the integration of actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change concerning strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA against islandin origin) may cause a change in the dose required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore needs to take into account the possible interactions in the therapy and always ask its patients for other medications taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a poorly controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and frutod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study, on which 1 072 patients participated, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (once a day 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared to placebo (placebo) and allopurinol (another medicine for treating hyperuricemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study, two doses of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each with allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, allopurinol was administered at a dose of once a day 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of patients taking adenuric in a dose of once a day took 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patients who once took 120 mg once a day, in the last three measurements a level of uric acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients suffering from allopurinol and none of the 134 under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart problems in pre-history, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in reducing the uric acid levels in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical trials, minor abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the Febuxostature treatment and in the course of subsequent clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas did not conduct interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition could lead to an increase in theophyll lenght (a hibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in the Febuxostature (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring any dose adjustment for either Febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving test subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x showed an average 22% increase in the AUC from Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies may not be related to side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatgroup in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were arterioscleral disease and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse events that could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with Colchicin. * * No severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed in the clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during long-term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostat- treatment groups and occurred in patients receiving Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypotesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of breath, skin discolorations, skin lesions, erectile dysfunction, increase of potassium concentration in the blood, increase of TSH concentrations in the blood, decline in lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mechanism of action uric acid is the final product of purinmetabolism in humans and arises in the course of the reaction cascade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for in vitro-inhibiting located below nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuric anemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month fixed serum levels of serums were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum supplementation at the beginning of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x per day) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data gathered in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheumatic cases, so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against rheumatic deformation (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gite, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the rheumatic nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased proportionally from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, greater than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After ingestion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3,2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum concentration levels, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma-type binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms, these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatute curonid mainly arises through UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-markedFebuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as an unmodified febuxostat (3%), the well known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, about 45% of the dose in the stool (12%), Acylglutide of the active ingredient (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%), as well as other unknown metabolites (7%) were found again.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased approximately 1.8-times of 7.5 μg r r / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g yr / ml in the group with severe kidney failure function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver function restriction After consuming multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, fertility impairment At male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly metered group, with approximately 11 times the human exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purinmetabolization and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">In oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, Febuxostat has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease where the bones are brittle) in women after menopause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who took Alendronat only (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headache, pain of the locomotor system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing) and acidic uprooting.</seg>
<seg id="1283">For patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be used in cases of esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1285">In January 2007, the European Commission granted the Merck Sharp & Doha Ltd Company approval for the introduction of ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Capsular, white to broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on one side and "710" on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE can only be taken with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except Pyloroplasty, are given only in particular caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses, such as oesophagitis, ösophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (partly these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal responses, and patients should be advised to consult the medicine when symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was found, rare (after market introduction) gastric and duodenalulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy contains primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a jaw-surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician is authoritative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be advised to take the dose of ADROVANCE the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum calcium up to &lt; 8,0 mg / l (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups showed similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereby the application of advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and investigated, such as Advagraf compared to Prograf / Prograft by the body.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or one of the other constituents, Advagraf may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be cautious if other (in particular some herbal) drugs are taken at the same time with advagraf, as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the same drug taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close meshed control of a physician experienced in transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advagraf should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level measurements (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus level mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure, measured as Talmud, was comparable to both nodular and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night-ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas may take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The orale advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The orale advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Shift from Prograf to advagraf must be converted to a transplant receptor of twice daily doses of Prograf capsules to one once daily intake of advagraf, so this switch has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplant must commence for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to anagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advyon-, pankle and colorectal patients, found Prograf in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood cell level in the targeted area may be required for patients with severe liver function disorders to reduce the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum levels, a calculation of the atine content and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporto to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of whole blood-tacrolimus-Talmud-controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus talent during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talmud of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advagraph, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or concurrent use of substances which may alter the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the Talmud level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmud of Tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close meshed control of a physician experienced in transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retardated formulation of advagraph are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data are available for the retarded wording Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, Prograf was known as cardiomyopathy treated aqua or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disruption are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retardants, lactose, special caution is given in patients with the rare hereditary lactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with the simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining even concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was made with antimycotic such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolic metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus action on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduce the Clearance of Steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious in decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of examinations in transplant patients do not provide a clue that compared to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy consists.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported via benign or malignant neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus should be mediated by binding to a cytosolian protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to the lack of Factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advents are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>

<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enabled it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients suffering from severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a 53 children study under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of adva in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blemishes with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side-effects of lawyers (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers across the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of the hemorrhage and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period of time.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of hemorrhages in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, and the risk depends on genetic and other factors within the first 20 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low- trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A among women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of ADVATE security profile, which makes PSURs submission every 6 months, the CHMP has decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another renewal procedure in five years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Krebs.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the unbroken p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Krebs, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the underbody, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers from the company to the questions asked to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-women meni-tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Comprehensive-Use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergenic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents under 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose) are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In the eyes of all hay fever symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerosaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, oral dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnolence), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against neuratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a lack of intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism) or a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the launch of Aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), it should not be applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease during long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the 2 weeks following the completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolepamine, dihydroergotamine or other decongestiva, which can be performed perorally or nasal as a loss of rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxyacetazoline, napolazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient's collective and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aaemia should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to impairment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental attention, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuce.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigid and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage may cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergenic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nose mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnicity affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose of pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes following the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the Peruvian application of aerosols in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetical multi-dose-study, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the ubiquitous administration of Pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Lorentadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the approval application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drowning or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heart chasing, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport and the use of machines In use at recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze leads to dizziness or decreases attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the given time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chasing, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in the urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Palpitations or heart rhythms, increased physical activity, redness, hot flashes, confusion, blurred vision, dry eyes, nasal breathing, nasal irritation, nasal inflammation, nasal congestion, pain or difficulty in urination, itching, shivering, decreased sense of smell, conspicuous liver parameters, restlessness, anxiety and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin, cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rash have rarely been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">In cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values, was also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg-fusion tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the cucumber, impairment of sleep and performance during the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for inserting and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of aserius resulted in an average decrease in the number of symptoms (symptom count) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of urticaria, the decrease in the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms end and resumed after the onset of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to dizziness that can lead to impairment of transport capacity or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study that was administered up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Aerius effectively reduces the loading of Rhino-conjunctivitis according to the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine disease is an causative factor in all of the caustic diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin, besides chronic idiopathic urticaria, also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrims at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with deslosatadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demographics were comparable to the general seasonal allergen rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Desloratadin and Lorentadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Lorentadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, Hypromless, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains hyrmless, Macrosell 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available to support the treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise neuratadin and experience a higher substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption, or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 announced Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company withdraws from Aflunov's application for the prevention of behavioural H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">The virus was then separated, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign).</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are participating in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for treating adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution to take in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with daily 100 mg of ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asrease according to body weight is directed.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS cannot cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug used with low dosed ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a virus load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, resulted in a stronger rubbish of the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued their protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Generase may not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are degraded as well as amethase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase take the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by a relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat patients with protease inhibitors outweigh the risk of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was found at the time of approval for scientific grounds." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "" "" "in October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited to bring amnesty to the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Genera capsules are usually to be given to the pharmacokinetical booster of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than the amprenavir capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on one milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily combined with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily combined with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzmus 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aspirase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment weigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous injection of amvase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, amperasis may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">For hammophilous patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous haematoma and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), osteoarthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with inferior therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic breadth and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzmus 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to virological failure and resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and release the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, by 30% lower for CMAx, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">Doses of 600 mg amprenavir were administered twice a day in clinical trials twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacokinetic study on the use of Agenase in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antazidi component of Didanosin it is recommended that the income of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin potentially lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, care must be taken because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Care must be taken when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Rifabutin caused an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenase, at least half of the recommended dose should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of Ritonavir with 200 mg Ketoconazol once daily resulted in an increase in CMAx from ketonavir to 2.69times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg Ketoconazol once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may possibly interact with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with amethase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida may not be taken at the same time as Abogenase since it may result in resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent asgenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side-effects with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cornetisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous injection of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of treatment weigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are notable increases in plasma levels while administering aphorase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while amprenavir can be administered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, aspirase may not be applied together with the oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same time, caution is advisable with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for concurrent application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate possible increase in plasma levels of midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of rite-avir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at this time, such as amprenavirus dose is to be adjusted if amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A remanufacturing study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the nicking in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of posterity, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of aspartiase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely lead to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenase or another medicine used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were assessed by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsoceral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113 antiretroviral targets treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTIs showed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs for a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash was usually mild to moderate, erythematose or mackulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low dosed ritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory alterations (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory alterations (Grade 3 and 4) were observed very frequently in patients who received Agenerase together with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is informed of signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral goos- and gag-pol- polyesters with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentric concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir therapy schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors did not occur pretreated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I54M, V77I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APP30003 and its extension APP30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks in patients with virological failure following the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analysis analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations of L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / F / F / F, I62V, V82A / F / F / G, I84V and L90M with a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic analysis based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (isolation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral, non-pretreated patients, in which a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indentavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear to cause.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open trial, in which PI pre-treated adults (100 mg twice daily) and standard of care (SOC) were treated with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to aspartiase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the time-adjusted average change from baseline (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submarine threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased aspartiase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested for intake and capsules 3 times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed rite avir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbiased" "" "aspartiase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for CMAx, by contrast, lowered by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influenced the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State through the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made up of 14% less bio-compliant than the capsules; therefore, the Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal impairment should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in doses that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data to the human being, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there were little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test of rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies that were treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In case of systemic plasma exposure that was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus-ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily combined with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be taken with care in patients with weak or light liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to virological failure and resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increase, by 30% lower for CMAx, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Care must be taken when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cornetisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg norethindrons) resulted in a decrease in the AUC and Cmin from amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentric concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbioosterated" aspartiase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State through the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of renal impairment should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in doses that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2217">According to the study plan indicated by the clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe mold growth and reduction (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent one-time oral intake of 200 mg ismiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines have been demonstrated in the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy in the treatment of a complete healing of the injections during an Imiquimod treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod, the patients cured completely; this was the case at 20% of the patients with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing was achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with five-time application per week for 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed individual primary superficially basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients had been clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external tilt, actinic keratosis and superfictional basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine was not shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three weeks weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml during the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod to topical application on MC-diseased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight; a study of the dermal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk to humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours appeared in the group of mice that were treated with the active free crème before and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed adverse events you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignees (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sex organs) and anus (anus) ● Surface basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to deformation, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to solar radiation during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in case of shallow acute keratosis in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Creme supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have previously used aldara cream or other similar preparations, please inform your doctor about this before starting treatment. o Use Aldara Cream first if the area to be treated is healed after a previous drug or surgical treatment. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and nasal mucosa.</seg>
<seg id="2249">In case of accidental contact the cream should be removed by rinsing with water. o Wend the cream not internally. o Use the treated place after applying Aldara Cream does not occur with a bandage or bandage. o If reactions occur in the treated area, which will give you strong inconvenience, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, swelling of the skin or difficulties may occur when the foreskin is retracted.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra, in the vagina (vagina), the cervix (cervix) or inside the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">If other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently been used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod overcomes breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in the case of filia, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the hands and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin under it (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks each week, apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side effects (expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent side effects (in case of less than 1 out of 100 patients expected) rare side effects (in case of less than 1 of 1,000 patients expected) Very rare side effects (in case of less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist about this immediately if you feel uncomfortable while using Aldara Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds strongly to treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected area of skin with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A low number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain from you faster or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of the patients), burning (26% of the patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Mostly it is about lighter skin reactions which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, shredding, skin protrusion, blistering, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, swelling, swelling of the eyelids, sore throat, swelling, swelling of the eyelids, redness, face swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the not neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following not neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements more difficult, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyms should be administered in a hospital or clinic with recovery devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study focused mainly on the safety of the drug, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may be known each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of aldurazyms will observe patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the integration of alduracyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovarian of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme treatment in patients with a reliable diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions defined as any associated side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should be closely monitored closely, and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting, in which revitalization devices for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase III study it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of an oversensitivity reaction has to be cautiously treated after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pre-treatment 60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or anti-pygents) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-induced reaction the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to breast milk over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mostly reported as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and in 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with aldurazyms observed during the Phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older have been reported in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs reported severe reactions including bronchospasm, breathing stills and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesired drug interactions in connection with aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe expiration and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated within 3 months from the beginning of treatment to a seroconversion, with a more severe follow-up form usually within one month compared to a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase III trial (resp. until a premature ejection from the study) 13 / 45 patients had no detectable antibodies by radioimmunostaining (RIP), among them 3 patients with whom it was never a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG-mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the appearance of undesirable drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme treatment therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient reconstitution of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients had a medium phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received a further 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg of aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with aldurazyme compared the placebo group to improve lung function and the ability to walk in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as emerges from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV was not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first four weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year, open-phase 2 study was carried out, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dose was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased levels of Gag- Mirror in the urine of weeks 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) showed normal mental development speed after the Z-Score (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe traversal form there were only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyms metering schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that is available every year, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in one-off administration, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2336">Since no compatibility studies have been carried out, this drug may not be mixed with other medicines, except with the ones listed below.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as a therapy for patients who have not previously been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy therapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrex thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy versus their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in 571 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further medication against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in Cisplatin alone.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, Alimta's average survival time was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparison drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the launch of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except in prevalent plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loc- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for vast discrete layer epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed administration and the day after the treatment a corticosteroid is given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrex, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) per week prior to the first pemetremixed dosage and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetremixed, a complete blood-picture should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transmase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking account of the presence of the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum hematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reducti- or - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65, or in comparison to patients at the age of 65, there was an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, dose adjustments were not necessary in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, exceeding the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transposition of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not studied especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marrow and Pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophilological count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet count again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrospinal levels, platelet count and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment courses (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of level 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia were observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all treated patients must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrex (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrex (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetrexed-Treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed when this agent was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible impairment of reproductive capacity is due to Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the reference guide to consult with regard to the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in a reduced Pemetremixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or asce- tylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrex (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with pemetrex must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulas and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for using pemetremixed in pregnant women but, as with ande- or antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed cannot be applied during pregnancy except if it is obligatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to get advice on the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetremixed enters the mother's milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetremixed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who randomized cisplatin received as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2426">Severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular insulin and transitory ischaemic attacks were occasionally reported in hospitals studies with pemetremixed, which is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In clinical studies patients with pemetremixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhonic).</seg>
<seg id="2428">In clinical studies patients with pemetremixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial Pneumonia with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported on cases of acute renal failure in pemetremixed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients that were irradiated before, during or after their pemetremixed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate, which exercises its effect by interrupting the metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies show that Pemetremixed acts as an antifolate with several attack points, by blocking the thyme dyspasthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and purinucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, single-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma, showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month survival compared to patients treated with cisplatin only.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">Statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the case of the Lun- gencancsymptomatala in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the allcertain Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival time of 8,3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2500">Dissolve the contents of the 100 mg / ml cup syringe with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a concesration of about 25 mg / ml of pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Dissolve the contents of the 500 mg / ml cup with 20 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a concesration of about 25 mg / ml of pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish, without compromising the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is applied to obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low-calorie, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot degrade some fats in the diet, causing about a quarter of the fats allowed with food undigested the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year versus 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study of Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on after, flatus (winch) with studlabeling, step pull, greasy / oily chair, exit oily secretions, flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as Warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be applied in patients suffering from a long-term Malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or in cholestasis (liver disease), and pregnant and nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence for the company Glaxo Group Limited to launch orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed to weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only resorbed to a minimum, elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist at the beginning of a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contraception in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and cephalporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained normal.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodarone, a marginal decline in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal flora and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known adverse events determined after the launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick recovery of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipasinhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastran and pankreatical Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times daily, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypothetical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (output 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be found sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after cleavage of the N-Formyl-leucine-group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plastic concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2570">For more information on the blue pages in Section 6, you will find out more about how to define your calory and fetus boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat, do not take any capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk nutritional deficiencies (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to your body's new eating habits, start before the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutritional diaries are effective since you can understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To safely reach your target weight, you should set two daily goals in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• You eat greasy to reduce the probability of diet-related side effects (see section 4). • Try to move more before starting taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity. • Stay during intake and also after the end of the intake of alli physically active.</seg>
<seg id="2578">• If you cannot determine any reduction of your weight after 12 weeks of use of alli, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the action of the capsules, resulting in more fat being excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the start of the treatment, as you may not have significantly reduced the fat content in your diet at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional-related side effects: • start a few days, or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of you will exceed your fat limit. • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial aftertable, as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Do not store pharmaceuticals for children. • Do not store alli after the expiry date specified on the carton. • Do not store over 25 ° C. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silicones, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2600">What amount is appropriate for you, take a look at the information below, which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you. • Because of the capsule's effectiveness, adherence to the recommended fat supply is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to the recommended fat supply, you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try to increase gradually and continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you do not go down on a daily basis or do other physical activities. • "Medium-physical activity" means that you burn 150 kcal daily through exercise, e.g. through 3 km of walking, 30- to 45-minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a lasting weight loss, it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat goals and to keep it up. • Sense is a nutritional diary with information about calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies which are a moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1,842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki-Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the integration of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severely ill-treated chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids which have been given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients should be closely monitored with anamnestial obstination or signs of subacute ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with the simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, aloxi is not to be used either for prevention or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron impedes the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micrograms (total of 633 patients), which at least possibly related to aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is unlikely to be effective in an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron (half-value 7.3 hours), which was given intravenously in day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbacin plus 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron received intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies of moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular death and repression and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations, a slow elimination from the body with an average half-life time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration in 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations it emerges that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days total text position (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous injection in healthy eyes, the total body type was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination cycle time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions, which are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular death and replication and can prolong the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about the 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended for the use of alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-effective component that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal product" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon disclosed data that corroborate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon compared to the efficacy of the reference physician was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided for the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with alpheon, the disease decreased in more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is immune to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection with crust formation) and small infected infirations (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provably or presumably caused by methicillinesresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected derailments, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wound, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been noted that altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (empty cavities in the body tissue) or infections provoked or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation on the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections in case of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the launch of altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully reconscientiously and appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamines should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of concurrent use of retapamines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in people after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol, the mean retapamic AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on skate skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical treatment in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be continued / ended, balance the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that were used by altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conrod mutilin, a substance obtained by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, partly blocking P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s-Bosnian subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinapamulin at least some infection forms appears questionable, consultation by experts should be aspired.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 of the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 abraded skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibit.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo-examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats any indication of limited fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved by up to 5 times greater exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topographical application to 200 cm2 of skimmed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation for placing on the market agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and are described in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional RMP updates which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management System for Human Use, the updated RMP is to be submitted concurrently with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It should not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gauze, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum pouch containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within the framework of a two-dose antibiotic, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can end up in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a booster dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twinrix adult and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for the protection against the same diseases, however, both adults and Twinrix children are given children under a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult ingredients contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet Adult were also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six months and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a licence for the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for basic immunization with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccines, taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster vaccination is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovinal vaccines or a combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and Anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and Anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovinal vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent individuals who have addressed a hepatitis C vaccination need a booster vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of formalinised hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels may be reached after the immunization, so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vaccine may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteus muscle could lead to a suboptimal results, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanically, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheritis, tetanus, azellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it may be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerang and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccination unit Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the test subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the volunteers who had given the Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per proband compared to 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturality was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose-vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinised hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6 to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccine trials involving serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the anti-HAV serum rates were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the rates of seroprotection (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after injection of the 3-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose-vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinised hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units with a combined Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the mating of a combined diphtheritis, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar Seroprotection and Seroconversions for the present formulation as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes both before and after resuspening.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as bathing in waters contaminated by effluent waters.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses (though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier inoculation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination unit (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences / or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicine (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated or has received / has received / has received or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known for placing the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP view that the benefits risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only brought into circulation in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided into several single sockets for meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomiesli (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading hose) or a nasal sonata (through the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparable study since ammonium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo-based medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, high ammonia values were effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonium was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information on this medicine was prescribed due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzymatic deficiency has already manifest in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication for use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine patients with arginine synthetase deficiency must be taken in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the development of esophagus ulcera, if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be applied with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate are taken over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in pregnant women is unknown; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate power, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an occasional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of digested sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of the excretion of nitrogen (sodium benzene, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartum (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rates were 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Ornithintranscaramylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and thereafter continued to be treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is converted into liver and kidneys enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disorders or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable next morning after nocturnal fasting no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Garulat is either taken orally (infants and children who are not able to swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomieside or a nasal sonata.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) before birth, there were lesions in the brain cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate power, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of tests on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granules form, 15 minutes after ingesting measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring scoop of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication using a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water) before use.</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate may influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not use AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, loss of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for initiation of the appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value for electrocardiography or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure), and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox was - with or without a gift from GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other hiudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently, as well as for people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the treatment of ACS and PCI is a acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004 The Medicines Company UK Ltd was approved by the European Commission for the launch of angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">To treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST recovery infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt release of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous release of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single angiox bolus administration has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the cleavage dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without any dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 Patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur in PCI patients under bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur throughout hemorrhage during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin is reached again prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in each case are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin-group and in the treated comparison groups compared with heparin-treated comparison groups, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined following the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliant plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reducing the hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood-localizations occurred, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 are more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system categories.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinary inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as the anionic indenture region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible since Thrombin turn the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, there was no thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is unable to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working times than a short-acting human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot metabolise insulin, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any other component, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection, either in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced amount of glucose and the reduced insulin supply, insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the activity of the insulin type, the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopyramid, fibrate, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifylline, Propoxyphene, Salizylates, and Sulfonamide-Antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympathizers such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethiine and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin passes into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter the mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following clinical trials are listed, grouped according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 /</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia associated with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisine and the duration of action is shorter than for cou- mant normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin luliage in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 L / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was clear from the data that a similar post-denounced glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin lulisine 2 minutes before the meal, just like with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisine was inherited 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denounced control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisine is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved as with a human insulin analog which is given 2 months before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin was given 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and in comparison to normal insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human normal malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
