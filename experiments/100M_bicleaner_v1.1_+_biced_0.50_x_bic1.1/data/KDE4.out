&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will find in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the whole &amp; URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand .
only web pages can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page by yourself , where you can insert transl@@ ative texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Add extensions .... Open the cartridge card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of default settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crash . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; dropping , or the list of crashes , if any , delete .
the View Sam@@ ples module ( also called folder filters ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ arium , all other k@@ not are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree Maps enable the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; mirrors size is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if it is far below the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command to be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles possess meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the easy detection of the inter@@ locking depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( and hence display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
with representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . it is drawn frame to indicate the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame will need space , which is then no longer available for the subordin@@ ate entries .
as allocation of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation remains up to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frame so that rect@@ angles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View Vie@@ ws at Area . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the Module Gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras gallery gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you view the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images per line have a slider and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of thumb@@ nails on each line in the gallery .
with the check box file name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file choos@@ er Save to HTML @-@ file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a turning field until which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
with the check box original pictures , you specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
with the check box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation range in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; display menu under the navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation zone ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
changing browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add the browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change the browser &apos;s recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to connect to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the set browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; edited ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes ... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined connection . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all the information you need is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list from &amp; edited ; .
when you &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . just enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ kam stack up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be modified .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; sever@@ s recur@@ sively the library path in its entirety . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folder unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this lets you insert extra &amp; digi@@ kam ; do this by inser@@ ting a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ded List have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ kam may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Pre@@ ferences and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and carries the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras is available under this link .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ kam can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a feature when the changes in &amp; edited ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either change the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau , over the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only limitation is that you can put an image not in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common ones : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies , and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . so filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed in the symbol view .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; edited are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select the album properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you used will be used to sort your photos when you select collections from the tool@@ bar or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort .
buttons Ol@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead .
if you first opened an album in &amp; edited ; open the first image in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; Next . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the section My Key@@ word list left in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . which information is this , you can edit the settings . select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor take a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such an aid window .
photos are all what it &apos;s all about &amp; editing ; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . you can access all the features with &amp; digi@@ kam . you can access all the features with &amp; digi@@ kam . you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the right mouse button and editing the context menu . in the editing section , you can see how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how you can adapt it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing through other image editing programs , it may cause problems with the metadata in the image . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo taken from &amp; edited ; delete , it will be moved into the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der@@ quot ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; edited ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
tags feature a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My cue list , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG , so you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button , or clicking on an existing keyword and then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New keyword &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be applied to the keyword of this keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword . a keyword can be only once in a tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to be able to use keywords , you first need to provide your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you wish to provide with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail &apos;s preview and select the cue from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the photo &apos;s context menu and select Del@@ ete from the menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection , which appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
next to this search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all the images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search that filters what you typ@@ ed as a search criterion .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the Text box Save as is used to assign a name to my search list in the View My search list . if you want to change your choice after searching , you only have to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select search editing , the form to enter search appears again with the search information you entered . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the advanced search dialog appears to help you find your previous search . more information can be found in the Find tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added line wise , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group . any option can be linked to other via the logical operations all ... , A ... , No ... or at least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it while pressing the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter , which is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; edited ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview strip you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize preview from the tool@@ bar and perform slide operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed in the other picture . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button at any preview screen to view it in the left . this simpli@@ fies to work through a number of similar images .
of course the normal dele@@ tion actions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swi@@ vel the visible part of the image , you must click it and hold down the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - aside from the fashion word ? digital Stock Management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos receives , scans or digit@@ ally saves a form of digital stock management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , convert , convert , group , backup , evaluate , sample , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Manager accepts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ or@@ ised , searched , transformed , assembled and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find a particular photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam . . the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you have been using your date several times . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work processes , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend that metadata save metadata in the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam site . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign each photo keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . you start the best with the evaluation or ranking .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or continue Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata consists of many sections in truth . file names and calendar data are the properties of all images .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people just want to let your photos be seen , they want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance you will not even have a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength just to work with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . K@@ DE even provides a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that one day , you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic indications . you can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who is offering the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright passages , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machines can delete or change this , in the picture , digital water@@ marks . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for stac@@ king processing in the near future .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , dis@@ semin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated prud@@ ently and you can no longer believe you than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVD , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ Manufac@@ turers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers offer a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : flo@@ ppy study
in short : disks are the longest if they are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make up a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . so , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers produce over@@ voltage protection devices that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models will allow you to continue working until the current runs . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under and Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when an error occurred to you , not if it happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at low levels and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of thi@@ eves is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new install@@ ations@@ . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; lin@@ ux ; has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural barrier to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . so , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you are doing your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference gu@@ arding : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance . creates a complete sn@@ apshot at two points of time : the complete assurance and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the future questions .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your machine architecture , memory , and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record is recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ide / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db .
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard designed to replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for enhanced color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG This Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need for compatible camera formats . D@@ NG is now available on the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope that Canon and Nikon use it sometime .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why to replace the X@@ MP technology based X@@ MP technology in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original image file , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems with the link between the met@@ a file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes cut off by the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the Add a picture to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn on . another description on this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . when the connection is established , a fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music , etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; edited ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the preferred selection method by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button will be gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded .
if you use the All @-@ to @-@ download or download Sel@@ ected button , a dialog appears , with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are disc@@ arded . you can read the list of existing albums , such as regular folders .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at one time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only a few , then you must first select it and then delete the chosen dele@@ tion .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should check carefully if the photos were successfully taken into a &amp; edited album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera qui@@ ver completely , you should do so via the camera &apos;s menu , because this is much faster .
the file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing transmission opens three further options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- to % % d % H % H : % M in the editing field . switch the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of the recording to make automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver that information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Auto rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , you can use this to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case you save &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the option date @-@ based sub@@ al@@ cul@@ ars at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam . you , where the images are supposed to be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be shown on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam site ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , because this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ ge@@ o module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; lin@@ ux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude or lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the default coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ google eg .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com doesn &apos;t show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many adjustments that the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you have to edit in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be set to show embedded preview , or start image editing , so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ ders . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; edited ; import without losing .
images captured as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lumin@@ table , these settings will not be available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can hereby obtain better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image editing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ osity than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to high compression .
with the option TI@@ FF files you can comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
by setting loss @-@ free J@@ PEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal J@@ PEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to capture the pointed lights . the setting colors will generate some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various rose bulbs . last , you can try to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general cannot be sati@@ ated as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ m therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . to keep time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ xim@@ um algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data provided by the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ics @-@ Direc@@ ted ) generated the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening , since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to how to be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files will start .
color profile folder Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examines this folder then during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the t@@ int @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate on how your picture would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer may have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately , not for Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the pre@@ views .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes activate the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ box , you can edit the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam . when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the sections &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a photo and delete an album . &quot; &quot; &quot;
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam . if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions , you may need to save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , it may expe@@ dite the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam . .
panel Start search for new pictures forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you want it to delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; edited ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . previ@@ ew@@ ing the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / editing .
the image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; edited ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing features of image editing change your photos . none of the features will change the original photo before saving file save or saving the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should create a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery button or using the button Rest@@ ore image recovery in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last save .
almost any action in the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Un@@ undo or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer through the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image , image , or using the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large Automati@@ cally
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can also view the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can view this in the dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view this from &amp; edited ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; C@@ d ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print assistant from the menu album Export . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation column , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
in the labelling view , you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut to 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the app@@ rais@@ al is written in the Ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ code session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the word tree , this is applied only to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all compiled keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard key words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the above example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is shown on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a cue from the right sample tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in various settings .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area .
( 1 ) : the entry which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make sufficient background information about color management .
if your picture workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image output is by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and then think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I have chosen to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ cate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is emit@@ ting the circle . when you work as a s@@ RGB colour space , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to s@@ RGB , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , adjusting , automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Edi@@ ting Automati@@ cally try out of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the beam values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest range and a re @-@ ji@@ bing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color White Balance .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and click anywhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can store in a text file and relo@@ ad it later .
the default settings will reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color administration .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allow you to save your settings so that you can use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called sab@@ ati@@ er , was created when you replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically feasible . a further increase in the end creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a converted colour film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the results and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . with large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you do a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform you can look at in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ ality correction is set for improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool appears very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the application described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . below the graph three slide gates are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes .
the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a light picture as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and relo@@ aded later , using Gim@@ p Levels format .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram of red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Transi@@ tion Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example for the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a picture . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is most of the time linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a v@@ entri@@ cular arrow to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker for@@ ks and that the associated image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and relo@@ aded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . turn on the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam Channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color gra@@ dations .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left side of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with one &apos;s own rider .
the image preview has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . colour@@ less is made of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel will be different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ less first .
save and load buttons are used for this purpose . you can save and load any mixer setting for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Transi@@ tion Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . preserving the lumin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ fel@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow l@@ enti@@ l filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of the texture in the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief plot has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame to an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your picture . the image is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , fl@@ uted with a nice three dimensional frame .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam template , you can apply a template through a picture .
the menu image template can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears , reflecting the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but created especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image shar@@ per . in fact , it is not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it does a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
images without focus and most digital@@ ised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to blur@@ ring edges a bit blur@@ red . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in J@@ PEG images a camera is often applied for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already using a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a picture with the sharpen@@ ing value . you can access this with the menu entry correction file .
however , you should handle it carefully because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique is to re @-@ focus the tool . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry correc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview will help to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase of the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges produce .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply difference @-@ sum . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from the shar@@ per and therefore avoid beauty bugs in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected det@@ on@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen an image &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask .
in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0,1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
this is most often caused by a previously executed blu@@ r filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the die size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the palate . however , note that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the overl@@ apping , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally Un@@ sharp Mas@@ quer@@ ade produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blu@@ r . for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the G@@ lät@@ te knob uses the blur@@ ring of the range that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ ders and Advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values mostly smoo@@ then homo@@ geneous regions and allow details to be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
direction Dep@@ en@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise , a high value wa@@ vy @-@ like pattern will create . J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best fixed at a value close to 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step distance &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stepping focal length in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ab@@ ort .
below you can see how picture errors with lesser art@@ ef@@ acts can be corrected . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is an odd black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blu@@ r the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks at the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or black@@ out occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or intoxic@@ ating tips can occur . place it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or J@@ PEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger .
atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of phase cushi@@ oning . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high a blur@@ ring may occur .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and relo@@ aded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected mit ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is luckily much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry correc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photographic arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
J@@ PEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any photo restoration can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Finish .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , textures are reduced to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Martin Dick @-@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark@@ picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and relo@@ ad it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise in@@ fir@@ ming effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction turns the transformation using a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a denial and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , t@@ onal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value changes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the Ton@@ nen@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction then all first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would appear to be the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cro@@ pping tool in the menu Transform@@ ative Cut out of the image processing or over the Zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the column @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is re@@ achable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to adjust film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . check the Fil@@ l Fil@@ ming option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny image specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; edited ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; edited ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ ths controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch yourself .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon distortion filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving marks your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture here is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : blur@@ ring the image through random shifting of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the colored bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to keep an area free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the correct orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the menu Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning and Trans@@ forming .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes here a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
retain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if a lot of noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this . each st@@ all@@ ying for photo can be saved as a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo blowing is very fast in what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . previ@@ ew@@ ing ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact .
in tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format is always assigned to the width .
cutting After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . relation button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data mirror the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ iling help enable you to blend aids in order for you to better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonious tri@@ angles : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way of sharing a rect@@ angle with similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden Center : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the deck@@ le leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; so ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates on this type a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and mirror verti@@ ces can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the default settings , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown in the upper right corner .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
corner left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
corner right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is slightly lubri@@ cated . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing .
a horizontal pattern , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformation she@@ ar .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . previ@@ ew@@ ing the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ oring , the picture is blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two shots generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ oring , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this depen@@ dency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that know . this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit the file in image processing . you can change this list of file extensions .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than J@@ PEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . it supports more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats supported by &amp; edited :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; understand these formats and therefore have no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies use to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited record in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module which exports a number of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting with the White Balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft signs , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform type of dialogue that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture Application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split@@ ting without dup@@ lic@@ ating . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the picture you want to preview . previ@@ ew@@ ing in the left part of the dialog will immediately be updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties page bar displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it while pressing the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for palette files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder by file .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check@@ box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button Color button , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the over@@ write check box at Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign , if another color follows . so if three numbers are stored in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
graph graphics ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph vi@@ z ; includes , are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ art viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ gra@@ vi@@ z ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ art ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; converts the graph into &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in one &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; pres@@ upp@@ oses representation of graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ art viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing space . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been changed by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be relo@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ ink@@ viewer ; can also note your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ art viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ art viewer ; view , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ art viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . once again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ al Store page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program any time .
the opening page gives the ability to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sit@@ ting Administration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives you the possibility to set the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ screen viewer . you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries described on the &amp; graph website are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ illuminated graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm generates a spring@@ board model for un@@ disturbed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ den@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid timer for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ finished graph@@ ene ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview shows if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ tile to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button scan , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . remember that the type BM@@ P will not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting Im@@ porting &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay sufficiently enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot has been created , the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

if you use the module for the first time you are guided by the process of generating a token . so it is used for your authentication . so it is your identification to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is started so you can login to Fli@@ ckr .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ckr &apos;s website . the following page will be presented after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ckr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at present , the module does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ckr server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Open , friends and family , you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed prior to up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the image &apos;s EX@@ IF setting , and loc@@ alization may be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file loads an automatic correlation which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera position . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog changes the coordinates from one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the region in question and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Inclu@@ de this again and again until you have reached an adequate level of accuracy . the map can always be selected between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization possible .
the tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select the albums that you want to export to HTML . you only need to select those albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on an image , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write per@@ missions . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ free Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in J@@ PEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this is also reflected in the P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog to which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . J@@ PEG is supported when writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . between the individual pictures you can add a basic visual transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you &apos;re planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can define the name and path of the created file with the name of the m@@ peg output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the film . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start creating the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or calm@@ ly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is e.g. : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . J@@ PEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you often plan to edit your images or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the J@@ PEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the J@@ PEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . use this mode if you are secure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images in an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent . other images can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the emails sent . it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used each time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the J@@ PEG format .
if you select J@@ PEG in images file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ ates will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . you can close this window with the button C@@ lose .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like your slide show will be displayed . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option will show that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects that you can choose from . random@@ ly , any transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop surface .
once you have finished your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse and photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now are present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in this context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have proper pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify which image to display for each individual . to do this , you need to open the picture view window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the contex@@ tual menu . in the View window you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string into the let@@ tering or description field , the labels or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either a part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start and photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry c@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview icon ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ Ex@@ ample Pages see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be created on the overview page . you can find information about the export files in .
last , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information being displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are exported from a party .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any more images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . so he can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really all are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . so the import function , see , correctly , you will have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work will not happen again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share that file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is supposed to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
with the option manually copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images were already compressed with J@@ PEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu file ... select , will import &amp; photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the Im@@ porting Wiz@@ ard consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures you often want to jump inside different picture groups . if you want to look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically use them in future starts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; photo@@ album , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options .
to the left , you will see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
we have described how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , e.g. objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are set up in a group instead of explaining all groups of a group as explained in .
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface .
the modules can be accessed through the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures . demo database can be either using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which makes it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now .
besides the current album and photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here is a photo album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , it will do so , so if you would have chosen persons to view and share it with the module .
since some modules with a photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to comment each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image was taken . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , by moving the names used up , find and assign people faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon by date on the list .
if you have selected any comments for each image , you may wish to edit all selected images and provide these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the image to the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multi @-@ entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that the USA shows as an over@@ print group . to show you that it is an over@@ load , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the Com@@ ment dialog by clicking and moving the gro@@ in that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the window &apos;s look to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click the Options button ... , which gives you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then window / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit selection from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without saving you on the hard drive . of course you have to save the images somewhere , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view these images as well . you can also not view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into . &amp; photo@@ album ; if you wish to avoid trouble as to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also trigger all the pictures that your little sister may see , and choose the menu item Every@@ thing except the current view .
with this you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will display all the images you have locked . if you want to see the images again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change the password in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours to describe you is of course that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason &amp; Photo album ; through a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is to be displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with tro@@ mb@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; photo@@ album ; can be changed to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom into the image and zoom out . with the mouse button , you can easily move a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ ic operations that work in videos that come in and out are combined with the plus and minus key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and look at other images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have attributes placed on your images , they are available in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you simply put them all at once with notes . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint pictures on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to switch on the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the painting mode from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have necessarily read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wi@@ re@@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position :
with del@@ eting , either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can delete previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click on Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with ab@@ ort .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the camera and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the p@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere .
you can save the current window view with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu entry view scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View menu View Mode ... select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the size card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or window effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as default an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is repeatedly further divided and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ess depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method POV @-@ Ray uses a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , a grid of four pixel is calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of four additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
what is the difference between the two ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit the object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; ren@@ ders a scene . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your retention and version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. al@@ timet@@ ers ) in the paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the Windows Type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire @-@ model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to return .
if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross ground , a floor is rendered under the objects . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section , it will be explained how you can create and save window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector Standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list Ex@@ posed window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ o@@ ving .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ o@@ ving .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see the first startup of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu Edit . thus you now have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( bottom right ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera find . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the control point where you can change the point of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the button or press the input key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body header ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Apply or the input key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now shows the plane as well , even at the moment only as a limited end @-@ level . if you render the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select First Sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment is only a matt black material , because you still need to type settings for the pigment . always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumb@@ nail . now , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simplest one .
if you do not see any color on the header or the ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this record twice ( you can do it more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
always choose color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step as you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply ) so the ball has a contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have shifted the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select one color and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input key .
the brightness effect and reflection effect already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical arrows shot from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered is just a few sources of light and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
once you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a memory space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently re@@ vo@@ cable command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Un@@ do Un@@ do .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option . modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any hi@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be shown either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still have a look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider / small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .

the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color indicated when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ stop@@ per ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; gu@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that do not make any more than scan and save images .
&amp; Xen@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan and save images that do not make more than pictures and save them . &amp; gu@@ lite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; duct ; with the command input channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; gu@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en will result in an abor@@ tion and you will get back into the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will open the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the picture , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving must be selected a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; gu@@ lite ; images can be selected . dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; Xen@@ lite ; it should be saved automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select saving without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is numbered each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button On starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; gu@@ lite ; manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; duct ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; input .

you may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ short commands . thus , make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from the collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to make the user know why a script doesn &apos;t work .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . to do this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose , scripts are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if it has no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to show the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Mode indicates that a new piece is being applied . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Song path restric@@ ts the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Song ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , cleaning up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b ; downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the cat@@ er@@ ot@@ ation amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the -@@ p parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i script page by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the am@@ aro@@ k scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nonetheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re also searching for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you would like to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ experience your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you need to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have trouble comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in den &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain depen@@ dencies must be met for some of the compilation options so that they can be used . see the section System@@ Requi@@ rements section for details .
activating de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without difficulty in the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the m@@ oods bar@@ ometer .
shaping mood : this feature is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this modi@@ fies the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
disc@@ losing voice files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k preferences folder ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
when you save the playlist when you exit , the current playlist will automatically save &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , it will use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , based on the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keeping track of the current piece visi@@ bly causes the playlist window to open / un@@ roll in order to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing part changes to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is applied .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can select the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . press on Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the source of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection activated below for foreground and background color .
resume playback , that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start resume playback automatically with the piece at the place it was stopped at the last ending .
setting up the O@@ SD on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is ha@@ iry , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colours for let@@ tering and background . clicking on the color planes will open the color sel@@ ector dialog . if your own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors will be used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that should search &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting out how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the checked and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to add all the play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under Calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and , if necessary , create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in context browsers . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , it is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable it if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless the $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the per@@ l module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug you might need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
most of the installation problems are the easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in mind that there is only one mistake there if something is related to the fixing of a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been transformed into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show . you can also use the Short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your choice and then select from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one from the Back@@ end independ@@ ant approach , so the real question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. a sink ) .
that does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media need to be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just need a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS will also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you .
either you do not use the arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia react the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the registry to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
then try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run j@@ peg files , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer .
please report it to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command leaves &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken up by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find out the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running tracks when you are on another computer ?
this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running unit : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ windows . press on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will open in an independent , variable @-@ sized window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button creates a piece in the queue sequence in the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played back and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what does the symbol in the system section of the control bar look like ?

my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can import files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a declining value based on how often the play was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for one piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece exactly as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you &apos;re supposed to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release schedule that cannot be combined with Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes resulting in a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output to set up the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further supported . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed assistant for arts : )

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a playlist that is superior to all others .
in this chapter , it explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
beneath the running text display are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used as an equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window is made up of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .

playlist by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they represent information about the current piece on each different aspect .
if you have already used previous versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you may notice that the sub@@ window is starting . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the information can also be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z @-@ symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded by the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded Parts , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub@@ window , you will try and am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required to do so .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com for the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ts only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing artist / album - first the pieces will be arranged according to the artist , and there will be a further division according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing artist / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default is 0 - alb@@ um@@ name .
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the tool@@ bar . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter you can find a selection box that allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . besides , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter virtually shut off .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - this emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Per@@ form the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue , which will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; transfer the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section about the Media Player Browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n items ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
( s ) To move files into the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; undo the compilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - change a copy marked as a compilation back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the play@@ lists browser designed to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
also created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod .
below the tool@@ bar is a search area you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can get music from a entered URL . if you want to enter / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ cal@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z for example , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop . as soon as you enter letters there , only the pieces are displayed which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you type one in two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the commentary bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left side , you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist . to the right , you will find Play@@ list Save , Play@@ list empty and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the center of the tool@@ bar is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many other available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a slide bar for the playing position and the playing time of the current play is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu , you can access the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k settings .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful resource for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management got your big move into &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number will appear in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details of setting up these are later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio kit ) . this mode requires that you already have some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then choose loading . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes of random@@ ly mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded items will be added to the next item change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be b@@ yp@@ assed and you will not hear twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed , taking the setting of pla@@ ited pieces .
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces you want to add to the playlist after each play played . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick a number of play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; random plays from each of the featured play@@ lists will be added .
some scripts can make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on @-@ set .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog to select a script package to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , just activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to make an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have a running &amp; k@@ 3@@ b installation ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get a worse quality while coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide is intended to show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable install of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original document is finished , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , nut@@ shell Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to deci@@ ph@@ er WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in the in@@ definite effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is shown by which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to take place . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , just as if you have called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; B@@ race &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? -@@ remedy described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to view the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can copy only one copy of a CD which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create one copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , converting / sh@@ red@@ ding a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the B@@ race button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the B@@ race button .
this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings and even ways to modify the size and cut black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the view .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to it further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . to do this , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the included programs will give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have in common all &amp; k@@ de ; the program supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can obtain a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can be used only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Cop@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
with this it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@
&amp; Audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; a reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on en@@ coder installed on the machine .
&amp; Audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many en@@ co@@ ders encoding these wa@@ v files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . other en@@ co@@ ders need to be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has put together a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders need to be installed . all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something themselves .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver provides a small introduction about co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audio @-@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the copy protection mechanisms . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use of reading a &amp; CD is explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you can find more information about how this program is being used , and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
if the CD@@ DB response of CD data starts in accordance with the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if an en@@ coder was configured in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ figuration Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab - encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the default . it is important to note that before the en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main alignment dialog of &amp; Audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ co@@ ders , for setting up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that loose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important , as both codes generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ n &apos;t so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Genu@@ ine for music of teenagers , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding explaining the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t by l@@ ame and the title must be added by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio @-@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button of a button in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is important to note that this is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator : this is meant by the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirr@@ ored server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution needs to be installed first if this has not happened yet .
for the first opening , pre @-@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the encoding of the encoding . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the coding can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write rights on it ( eg ; trying to copy something into the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; audio @-@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it in any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be passed to the selection program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device records for CD and CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the General Settings tab . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be notified when data for generating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ; the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
note that if you want to enter everything manually , des@@ elect the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand . however , this is about 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in Off@@ line mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls work the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . des@@ elect the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smoo@@ thed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of concur@@ rent WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; audio creator ; finished . this configuration is used as default for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is set up in the previous section .
since we use a &amp; CD ; that is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of extrac@@ ting them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , the &amp; CD must now be pushed into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for Help in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window displaying , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but collect the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the box &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desirable comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders and / or file formats . see Help for the Ko@@ iler to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the tap@@ ered CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the fields of the current play .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear when downloading the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the BO@@ M list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece or select the All items button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if you have cli@@ cked on the selection process by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear as confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left of the window in the status line .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a coder that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this makes reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with powerful machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; Audio@@ creator ; is used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Package . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is addressed to people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , if it is running once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options on settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still am reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as to continue from this sort of blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
who reads this has probably started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual and audio @-@ creator . whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least after contact with the author . and if you are reading this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with that suggestion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to others , he also has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ us cards . Al@@ sa will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
when you stop playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ us cards ( for the latter you need the l@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press down the button down in the tool@@ bar , select the record pick from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right side of the tempo display and change the speed of the tempo . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not have to set anything manually . so , if you activate the Automatic Text option in the Settings menu , you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries of the text or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can sum up . these are played back in line . in this section , you can see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the winn@@ ings in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . remember , if you add a lot of items .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to continue a song , select the button Next , select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to get back a song back , select the button Previous item , the record Previous item from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter because it is not saved when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events which the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano to events of the type Change patch to tr@@ ump and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ us cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . a requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther ke@@ yst@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI .
in this section , it is stated how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a shot ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a rif@@ le shot .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note using Patch 127 ( shot shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where clay means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some of the key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
keywords are used primarily to map tones on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . watch the provided Key@@ words as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , you can easily do this in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will need to be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch &apos; option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in what ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI Settings . these can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which tones are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights up no more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view in the Settings menu , under the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to solve the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files separately .
OK , that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
by default , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you only want to play the first file . so set automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then includes exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this animated me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a little bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great pleasure to send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I &apos;m only getting more programmed because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .

and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and compile using the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , then you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; news item &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not run . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same with the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would be disturbing during the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ verter ; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab@@ s for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special em@@ bed field for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be returned in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file Zu@@ ordin@@ ances of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be launched in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to make a given back end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . the code to use must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
because the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , different names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there any hints on how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does every time my CPU must be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to compile &amp; play ; requires .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . using Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ tra@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , contact via the Ki@@ le ; website should be established .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling of &amp; boxes ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within it a simple , immediate and bes@@ po@@ ke access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unci@@ ation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ y ( eng@@ l lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master properly , good books should be used for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other label languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to define the most general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing , and text grass as well as a body with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for the creation of a document . some settings related to the document can also be made .
document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , author &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , slides &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration it simply needs to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file .
when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ command } ) .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( the highest and sub @-@ paragraph is the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the back search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the actual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and when cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding passage in the DVI file is spec@@ kled .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick@@ set : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is applied on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick classification of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections ...
the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector can be used to add items such as keywords , notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary inclu@@ sions . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is related to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e. e is used for setting the font sizes . it can be set the font sizes for the main text , the notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and defining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ Docum@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font sizes . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ Building or the button of a button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for the errors in the logging process . when using a quick installation &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few acid should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the change of font sizes within the environment .
changes are only considered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . at least a quote , a few places in the bold and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a large file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , just set up Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Building .
to search for a pre @-@ select search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
if the &amp; DVI file doesn &apos;t open , an error can be found . if there is an error , it will be sum@@ mar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and the La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the error line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the error line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting Emp@@ ty document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created in &amp; boxes ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selection of file templates ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings Gener@@ ate .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about it , and to know its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ click with a marked C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that you \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a click switch , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many wiz@@ ards can add additional ho@@ ck marks . this is a unique type of book@@ mark within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ t@@ Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically cleared when entering a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; quot ; provides excellent opportunities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
this aug@@ mented meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; box ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command will also select &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back tag ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for creating a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands here for a quicker possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit Des@@ elect paragraph .
it has been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under the editing environment for a more convenient work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or inside the \ \ begin { setting } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ sor clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group jumps ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a number of ne@@ sted groups braces , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used in &amp; boxes ; the character &quot; is used for two simple quotes . also for ending the request the character is &quot; used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and holds two en@@ closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ anni@@ c or French ) and with it German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when you click Shift ; enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; lt ; not only a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment : the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ending line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . in case of the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the underlying line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator may not be the corresponding table , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current table .
although &amp; quot ; already has a good source code completion , this has been extended in &amp; Ki@@ le ; in order to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are equipped for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Ki@@ le ... Compl@@ et@@ ely adjusted .
when starting a new environment by the command \ \ begin { surround } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the back button is at the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and the result list may be altered . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , the hooks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by working with the N@@ Ã ¤ k@@ est jumping @-@ mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Components can be made to these lists . there can be different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ dening of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for completion of environments . there must always be a couple of letters with \ \ begin to be entered and a full list of environment commands will result . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for upgrading the environments .
when you call the dialog box over the volume processing environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically opened and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient charge can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; boxes ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Components can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of changes to be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Complete . as an example of a cooling list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word modi@@ fies mode over the volume processing , or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Memory button , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large windows are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been established that many converts can be written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete shiel@@ ds can be de@@ activated . here , the threshold value for displaying the full charge can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Personal Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to examine the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups to compile comp@@ iling , creating and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by the key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be used in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when the command is used , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being developed on the Men@@ Ã ¼ project New Project .... here@@ with the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file .
the &amp; Ki@@ le script function ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tra@@ live ; delivered with many documents . it includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and herein a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an open@@ source and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who strive for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project and to sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . signatures are processed in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different cit@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for all day . for each day , you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this will give you an empty signature ; in the signatures tab . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the disk label Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu , or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ o@@ ving in the tool@@ bar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click right down on the user &apos;s button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all the stac@@ king elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking on an order entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor is transferred to the corresponding file number of the corresponding file in the main window .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows well and how outstanding it is . if we take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the root folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of the current working folder and enter the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is there a great graphical interface for that now .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an issue on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file be cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file and select the file to be reviewed by means of other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ For@@ med file is , click the Well @-@ For@@ med Test Sel@@ ection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; file specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of &amp; DT@@ D ; both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file be selected easily . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file will usually be stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; l@@ ends , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until somebody builds up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we start editing the Plugins menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something special happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
you can either select the comment entry from the Editor &apos;s context menu or add the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
note can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the specified nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive regardless of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over several pages , which are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; large / Small writing of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bulk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the tags are inserted in the same way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large / Small case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in the same way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if selected , is inserted for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not automatically include tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default preferences can be restored using button Standard .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file opening opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is affected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; produces regularly backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when starting the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be previ@@ ew@@ ed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful if the user interface has per@@ ched through changes of M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / app@@ end of views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable warnings from non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able warnings .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in split mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Adju@@ st@@ ment tab , the visibility of knots in the tree , the edi@@ table frequency of the tree when editing , and how deeply when changing the structure tree is to be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ PAR@@ K @-@ capable application , the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ Parts only refuse the load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . select allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely new . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed , with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally .
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger &apos;s session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to de@@ port a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script without passing information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger imple@@ ments the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if the current does not exist .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility make from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tags &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool lists are handy , symbolic gro@@ sts of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than the only element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the Tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , which is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
gives the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the source of the data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but make sure &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; start window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = reference 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an action can be set with Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions ... &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; click New Action for the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking on the User Defin@@ es button can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ 1 , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ sq@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ script t.@@ sh@@ . This allows you to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used . input can be determined in the input field , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages sent to the default output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the default output by setting the output sel@@ ector output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the cup .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag , &quot; if available so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should note the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , started , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; -@@ Tag in the current document is inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar and set the tool@@ bar dialog . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save in the correct folder . after it does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please fit your &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ urities
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , now see the &amp; PHP documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders are shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file attachment lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for using the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a final contribution , we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
the up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and convert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions Line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type day , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a number of key concepts . in order to understand them and to make full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only be used by the user themselves .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ gli@@ ges the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the editing pane , the tree views , the tab pages with information and tool@@ bars . please check in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all tab , relo@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rect@@ angles in the editor area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , help to the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter is a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as the default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; insert into your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow access to information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open them and strip them . in the presentation with car@@ ab@@ aries stand for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as add , remove , upload , or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . click with the left mouse button to call the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ hes the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab at the bottom end of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and any changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all bugs in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are any ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to change the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH is located in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly turned into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the section on templates . if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HTML &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; en@@ rolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces into &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switch on / off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
goes straight to a line number . this is very helpful if you run &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of the script and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
start @-@ up of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be added by setting actions . tool@@ bars are saved by Tool@@ bars Tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu default in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current date settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the following .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or un@@ attractive graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or sub@@ window mode , representing the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
turn off the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be completed from top to bottom , because , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties later .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote machine , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars as standard . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
allow files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder , and you can select an accurate selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or by using the Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations , such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information on Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ layer profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by holding its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , modified or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files are found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are as well , but the entries are missing Open and Open with ... in the context menu which can be accessed using the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about program ends . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk do not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ level profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tool@@ bars Project Tool@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own mode of operation .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best designed using the tool@@ bar menu . the use and addition differ . adding tool bars is discussed below in the Add tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be changed , or tool@@ bars can be set , which actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set actions to set actions .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; models supplied have conditions for their deployment . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are ne@@ sted in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way to be efficient .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see the template tree for more information .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure according to your preference ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File as Tem@@ plate Save as a local template ....
once this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File as Tem@@ plate save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Con@@ quer@@ or &apos;s file tree .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click on a folder to the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can give he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or associate with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify a folder &apos;s behavior , right @-@ click on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the regular folders in the template list . if a root folder would be set so , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this may be common he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a full command collection for adding or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another using the context menu ( press the right mouse button ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit , it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . pressing F@@ 9 will activate this mode , if this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke moves the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , with the position in the document maintained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta .... By choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view one can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatic . in principle , the recommendation : a small gap for fast computers and a large gap for slow .
let &apos;s assume that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of un@@ seen tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . the document property dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the sever@@ ing encoding .
met@@ a tags allow saving information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not yet supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
cur@@ sors are used like in a word processor , by moving with arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by using a back button or a distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way about tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables wizard or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be traced .
to be able to compile and compile it successfully , libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; are already available .
new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and activated later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded still file names with relative path to the work@@ folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a vag@@ ue called my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a given model name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the template template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; expands to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a given stop point must be termin@@ ated for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each passage .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to commit compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes . the merge @-@ editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can view this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both distinguish files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can make typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
folder 2 folders 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manually typing file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will remember your selection and display it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the ab@@ ort button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large amount of effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ te the dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a little help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well to see .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the abstra@@ c@@ ting column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file does not have rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Chan@@ ges &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also result in a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane , and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : when selecting sources ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate will mainly use the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page up , end , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the release window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if this is enabled , it is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminating manual copying . but be careful with this option because you may accidentally over@@ write the cli@@ p@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying OS . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart run + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 doesn &apos;t keep the line end of the source files , so you should also not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the shut@@ down and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Ex@@ 3 Set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the selected font doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered sc@@ anned . on these systems , the default settings will automatically display an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each sel@@ ector is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . then the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is om@@ itted .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
comparing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others save only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , the return marks are made visible , but they may be disabled as a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation about the directory comparison and merge operation .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is controlled globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for the coding , a short note of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply skip the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when you read a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only with the line @-@ up command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff @-@ results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .

while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they &apos;re very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in feature in K@@ Phr@@ ase . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ ys@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , i.e. virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the composition . example :
instead of used , you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete files recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merge . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder scan , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case , the join action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries varies .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B one file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B one file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging is copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge selection ( unsure ) is enabled , then investig@@ ates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging a file is executed after the other . it status column displays fer@@ v@@ ently when mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , C is used as a target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B is chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select Start / Continu@@ e in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : execute Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options passing , simul@@ ating and dis@@ connecting .
if you only want to see what would happen without making any changes , then you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , choose start / resume root directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next record .
if you breach the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them at the later mer@@ ging of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Phr@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
with links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default .
with links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders about a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
similar to the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the modified date has been lost when copying .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it will not change the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is switched off in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view will be visible to the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can split the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without first having the folder merge . to do this , the status will be set to default and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # file has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , per@@ missions or modification date vary from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently seen as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P starts at first the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Ex@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Phr@@ ase Show from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ oot , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Phr@@ ase Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Ex@@ 2 ( now it is Comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Ex@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or that way .
you have compiled the program from sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , no sr@@ c is left ; no sr@@ c is left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses a lot of colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ Ex@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the update folder after changes to these options . )
this will also cause identical files when mer@@ ging will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager ... and ending . if however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Bed@@ ding .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops .
if this field is enabled , the name of the virtual work@@ space will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual work@@ tops . if it is ti@@ cked together with the name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1. desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty working surfaces will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as out of p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini utility in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... the dialog provides settings .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is referred to below as a select window .
in default , you can magni@@ fy &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set up a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select screen mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are using the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is stuck and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against zero .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , relo@@ ading ( with the button Docum@@ ent re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Cut &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to increase the screen size in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / K@@ mag ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ backup center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and any mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which each mouse click will em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the simple evidence of the mouse , pain can also be caused .
to make it clear : even though it helps to avoid pain caused by mouse clicks , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
when Intelli@@ gent shifting is enabled , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait until the mouse button is released when no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click with mouse shift . if this feature is activated , a slow move moves to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears , you can and k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s last pushing back .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mou@@ sec@@ lick , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first , you should be aware of the position of a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to figure out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when an im@@ position has just begun . if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yp@@ ad . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : hold a mouse click at an end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , each time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when smart move the shifting time . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ review extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; sel@@ ects the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter passes . this program was designed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and cause pain to an@@ tigen .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to make a certain amount of time waiting for a drag process to begin before the mouse button is released . this way you can drag and drop with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; was developed by Gun@@ n@@ ar Sch@@ mi D@@ t Gun@@ n@@ ar @ dir@@ i @-@ d@@ t@@ .de , Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Jeff Rous@@ se Jeff @ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ol@@ .com .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text editor . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages used without typing them . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have mouth ; set correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is attached to the exp@@ iry date . you can select phrases that should be spoken once again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry , set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word completion and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the input field of the language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character encoding to be passed on to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as default input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action following the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the list of text passages .
with the selection of In stock , the selected text passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the exp@@ iry date . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
the book will be saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to reject any changes , the text box will not be saved . before saving , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message should be saved .
the word completion page contains a list of dictionary words for the word completion . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries to merge and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically add new words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
adding actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can be accessed either through the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the processor .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the processor .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the processor .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints of the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding table for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is placed by default via the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position .
probably you do not have the command for voice output correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s @-@ system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v

the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the placement of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application where people who cannot speak can print text through the computer . there will be a list of pre @-@ defined sentences that the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
for more detailed user documentation , please refer to help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmer ready to be equipped with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; kate ; , even when &amp; quot ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
the speech output is carried out via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; in which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ stam@@ mailing list . subscribe to the mailing list for ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ bab@@ .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it correctly .
at the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the tab card will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the tab General will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different types of male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up a number of variants for a syn@@ thesizer .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are similar to several printer sp@@ ears for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the speaker will display the speaker . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is yet set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred actors appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a tuning type here , three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice are available .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab nar@@ rator . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the tab General and check if language output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text .
if you have at least one speaker , you can launch the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders are displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , the K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it is running &amp; t@@ ts ; on , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the control bar when you read it , it will disappear once the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text you want to read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text you want to read and select Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; Plac@@ ement ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu . the settings for K@@ not@@ fy are different depending on the application .
filters for string replacement offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; in@@ correctly emphasized or fla@@ wed messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of the warning .
news has the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you get from the car@@ p card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are executed in queue , except for Screen re@@ a@@ vers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reader reads , this output is hal@@ ted and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal al@@ erts , messages , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which enable the replacement of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the speaker card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will continue to be modified to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . editing through the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample for the set of string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as desired , it only has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box This filter if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
by comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be called for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such changes . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the cartridge card or@@ ator , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends , and the features of the speakers established on the cartridge card . with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can click on the button with one click to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box This filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request voice delivery services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and write a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . launch t@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ convert filters , but web pages aren &apos;t pre @-@ read when using the module for Festival .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must do it yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and extend for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ gg or downloaded the recently created tar@@ ball , please compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check if the speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be further developed that the device of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or reject sentences , repeat , pause or cancel output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen .
if you click on the Spo@@ kes@@ person Spo@@ kes@@ person to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Vo@@ cabulary Book Spo@@ kes@@ person device will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the Festival . in Vo@@ ices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally speaking , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider controls you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click on Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application set up the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the tab nar@@ rator .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be taken over and des@@ kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or executed without support for the corresponding audio module ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you chose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about twice the normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this tab you can set up special actions which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that suggests news . if you &apos;ve just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the space .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , al@@ erts and the expenditure of screen re@@ a@@ vers there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the flash@@ card noti@@ fications appear .
tick this check box to turn on &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ ce Noti@@ ce . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will be rejected by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected a user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the speaker you want . default sel@@ ects the speaker that appears as the top entry in the list on the tab . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button load to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; the SS@@ ml only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice used to the festival in the issue of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch are not set in the festival configuration dialog , the SS@@ ml @-@ text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with advance reading , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set @-@ limit detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limit detection filters , but beginners are advised .
the easiest way to learn pron@@ unci@@ ation is to try out the language selection . switch on the selection of speakers and select text to read . switch back the subscri@@ ber selection , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changing .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the preview can start , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter will be automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit detection filters match text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the issue of Screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal set limit filter , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection tab , you can over@@ write subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the default speaker ( the top on the tab nar@@ rator ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; t@@ t ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely matches the originally set @-@ up features .
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as the primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case that you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .

on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ thesizer modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer themselves a setting for speed on the cartridge card for speaking device . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help with this find in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates speech from phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ phone from German lyrics .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and enables the setting of the network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from which the distribution and the release stick is best . by selecting the setting non @-@ again the setting can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then set this selection automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are shown in grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you will enter system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode all functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
when selecting Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected in the selection list according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be turned on or off as required . switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be turned on or off as required . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating Interface ....
establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons , or Her@@ unter in the priority list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog Edit .
the list Nam@@ ingly known computers describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list Nam@@ ingly contains well @-@ known computers some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the review will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit hosts will be shown .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in one &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface , such as k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second section all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf parameters are discussed .
this section may not replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found any major spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in alien networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks we mostly use addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ g ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = one &apos;s own host ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar , which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be involved in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; h@@ ars the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . does not recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the band does not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
when you recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , it searches for the right index on your disk . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives by a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be disc@@ arded without danger .
before a member of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted .
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted from the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , it continues &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select the Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup .
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection once and change the working folder for verification .
if you confirm the verification of the verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate re@@ manufacturing , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for Rest@@ ore . in this dialog , you can check your selection once and change the work@@ folder for recovery .
if you confirm the restore settings dialog , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the strip file using the band content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can recre@@ ate the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be stored is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the other files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time the creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
before the tape is involved , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ected at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat is activated when releasing &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy @-@ stre@@ amer .
not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a system log viewer . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . it will not appear to you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log directory , for which ordinary users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings . the list of the log rows is now automatically changed , so only log lines will be displayed . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log , so &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . tran@@ script lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color than protocol lines of the level hint . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog .
if you only want to show certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add to new lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main window context menu to display all new tran@@ script rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org you will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system quickly becomes the standard for the control of program starts when running the system in der &amp; Linux ; world . and that is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . so you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when switching to another run level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls go to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when driving .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can modify / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have done something , then you come to repair it by re@@ starting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the proper scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start ( or stop it ) at this level .
you can also move scripts from Run@@ level@@ ing or change the position within a level by reloc@@ ating it elsewhere . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ Level ( or its position ) . this will not happen unless you pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly choose Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target area of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ tia of the surrounding entries , before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run run run X , but they are not executed .
if you &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) use , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without a message if their configuration files are not installed or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adap@@ tion of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry of the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only shown if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled default restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created , where you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
the password management tab appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable from the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . parameters can be modified for each user , with the limited space limitations in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation .
the groups tab informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group belonging to the user can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ aries Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog features of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user group or group or click on the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
