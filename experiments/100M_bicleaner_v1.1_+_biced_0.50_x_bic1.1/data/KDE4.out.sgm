<seg id="1">"" "the module" "" "translate" "" "you will find in the" "" "Conqueror" "" "menu. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page by yourself, where you can insert translative texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings Add extensions.... Open the cartridge card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that contains & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; on Extras crash. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; dropping, or the list of crashes, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Samples module (also called folder filters) can be found in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentarium, all other knot are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree Maps enable the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; mirrors size is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even if it is far below the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles possess meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the easy detection of the interlocking depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (and hence display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always complied with. it is drawn frame to indicate the nesting of the entries, and this frame will need space, which is then no longer available for the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">As allocation of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation remains up to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by frame so that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View Views at Area. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the Module Gallery in the & konqueror; menu under Extras gallery gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you view the picture gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the option" "" "Title" "" "allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text box." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line have a slider and a rotational field to set the number of thumbnails on each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box file name of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Dialog folder, you specify where the gallery is saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file chooser Save to HTML-file, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set with a slider or a turning field until which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box original pictures, you specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the check box comment file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation range in the & konqueror; display menu under the navigation pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation zone; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add the browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser's recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to connect to & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & edited; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & edited; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes... This opens a dialog with an underlined connection. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all the information you need is listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list from & edited;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you & digikam; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. just enter a path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; will also use as an AlbenLibrary. settings digikam stack up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; considers every subfolder as an album. no image will be modified.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; severs recursively the library path in its entirety. you can't exclude any subfolder unless it iste in hidden folders. this lets you insert extra & digikam; do this by inserting a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albended List have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so & digikam may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderPreferences and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and carries the transfer of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras is available under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digikam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not available in libgPhoto2, thumbnails may not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a feature when the changes in & edited; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either change the page bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenbau, over the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only limitation is that you can put an image not in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common ones: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies, and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. so filtering on the filename only works if it is displayed in the symbol view.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & edited are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select the album properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you used will be used to sort your photos when you select collections from the toolbar or view albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Oldest, Average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first opened an album in & edited; open the first image in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the contextual menu & quot; Next. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the section My Keyword list left in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these thumbnails with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while while thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you can recreate all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. which information is this, you can edit the settings. select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor take a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such an aid window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all what it's all about & editing; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. you can access all the features with & digikam. you can access all the features with & digikam. you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Edit... or selecting the right mouse button and editing the context menu. in the editing section, you can see how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contextual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do this, and how you can adapt it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing through other image editing programs, it may cause problems with the metadata in the image. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo taken from & edited; delete, it will be moved into the garbage dump of & kde; moved. F8 image Delete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumsliderquot; organizes your photos according to the data. & edited; use either the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags feature a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold up parts of the tree & quot; My cue list, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also re-import your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button, or clicking on an existing keyword and then selecting" "" "New keyword" "". "if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be applied to the keyword of this keyword." ""</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword. a keyword can be only once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the" "" "Edit menu" "" "context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu as album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In order to be able to use keywords, you first need to provide your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos that you wish to provide with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also click on the thumbnail's preview and select the cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of tags. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the photo's context menu and select Delete from the menu. the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection box that indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection, which appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to this search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all the images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open it you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search that filters what you typed as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the Text box Save as is used to assign a name to my search list in the View My search list. if you want to change your choice after searching, you only have to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select search editing, the form to enter search appears again with the search information you entered. if you choose to edit as an advanced search, the advanced search dialog appears to help you find your previous search. more information can be found in the Find tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added line wise, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group. any option can be linked to other via the logical operations all..., A..., No... or at least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes every picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. if you push a picture from anywhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini-program. you can zoom in or zoom out or move it while pressing the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter, which is then added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image data formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window opened. if you are back in & edited; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize preview from the toolbar and perform slide operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed in the other picture. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same. use the left mouse button at any preview screen to view it in the left. this simplifies to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course the normal deletion actions work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swivel the visible part of the image, you must click it and hold down the & LMB; in the preview mode both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - aside from the fashion word? digital Stock Management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos receives, scans or digitally saves a form of digital stock management. most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, convert, convert, group, backup, evaluate, sample, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Manager accepts, indexed, categorized, secorised, searched, transformed, assembled and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to find a particular photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digikam.. the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you have been using your date several times. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to re-organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that metadata save metadata in the metadata in & digikam site. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so, you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign each photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. you start the best with the evaluation or ranking.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or continue Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata consists of many sections in truth. file names and calendar data are the properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people just want to let your photos be seen, they want to share it with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance you will not even have a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength just to work with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. KDE even provides a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are already innumerable and will be deepening in the future. I am sure that one day, you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic indications. you can also export kml files you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example to protect the photographer's identity, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who is offering the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright passages, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machines can delete or change this, in the picture, digital watermarks. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you can find problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated prudently and you can no longer believe you than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVD, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control humming. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a favourable program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">DiskManufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers offer a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: disks are the longest if they are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make up a lot of electric shocks, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these anomalies can cause serious damage. so, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers produce overvoltage protection devices that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coax cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models will allow you to continue working until the current runs. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under and Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory in the offer. thus, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when an error occurred to you, not if it happened in your hardware. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a GPL incompatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrf file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & linux; has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural barrier to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anybody responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year. so, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you are doing your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore DesasterPrevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbour house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference guarding: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance. creates a complete snapshot at two points of time: the complete assurance and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, associated XMP files, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the future questions.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your machine architecture, memory, and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record is recognized by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted reside / dev / sdc1; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb / sdb.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software to read, then you can create them yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for enhanced color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG This Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need for compatible camera formats. DNG is now available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope that Canon and Nikon use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why to replace the XMP technology based XMP technology in 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original image file, mostly in raw format. XMP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the link between the meta file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images again, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; in the Add a picture to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn on. another description on this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. when the connection is established, a fertig indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file, photos, movies, music, etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & edited;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the preferred selection method by & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and download Selected. the selected download button will be grayed until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded by & digikam until now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the All-to-download or download Selected button, a dialog appears, with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are discarded. you can read the list of existing albums, such as regular folders.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at one time by deleting the Delete All. if you want to delete only a few, then you must first select it and then delete the chosen deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should check carefully if the photos were successfully taken into a & edited album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera quiver completely, you should do so via the camera's menu, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames, if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During transmission opens three further options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo- to%% d% H% H:% M in the editing field. switch the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of the recording to make automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver that information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Auto rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, you can use this to automatically load sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case you save & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the option date-based subalculars at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam. you, where the images are supposed to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be shown on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam site; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailer and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save this data in gpx format, because this is the only format supported by the geo-geo module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude or latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the default coordinates created by maps.google eg.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com doesn't show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible. there are many adjustments that the behaviour of & digikam. to access these settings, you have to edit in the Settings menu. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to show embedded preview, or start image editing, so you set the default behavior of & digikam. if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the picture that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data to the corresponding IPTC-Felders. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & edited; import without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images captured as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; tries, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the lumintable, these settings will not be available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can hereby obtain better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image editing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminosity than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">By setting loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned in due to the incapacity of your camera to capture the pointed lights. the setting colors will generate some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various rose bulbs. last, you can try to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general cannot be satiated as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcram therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image editing. to keep time for the demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaximum algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data provided by the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">After some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenics-Directed) generated the quality for me and the paper used by me. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color softening, since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as to how to be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files will start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digikam; examines this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard source; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the tint-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate on how your picture would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer may have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for. unfortunately, not for Canon models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes activate the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection, trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">"" "with the option" "" "confirmation dialog" "" "for moving &gt; pictures in the trashbox, you can edit the conversation between & digikam. when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in the sections" "" "Delete" "" "a photo and delete an album." ""</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digikam. if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any questions, you may need to save the changes with the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digikam; when starting, it may expedite the start-up of & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="334">Panel Start search for new pictures forces & digikam; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you want it to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & edited; used to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design. previewing the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & edited; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing features of image editing change your photos. none of the features will change the original photo before saving file save or saving the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should create a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery button or using the button Restore image recovery in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action in the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Unundo or Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; press a moment longer through the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image, image, or using the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally, you can also view the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can view this in the dialog by & digikam. you can view this from & edited; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File menu and get the Standard & Cd; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">Entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print assistant from the menu album Export. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation column, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut to 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The appraisal is written in the Urgency IPTC field. the code follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & digicode session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the word tree, this is applied only to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all compiled keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard key words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is shown on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a cue from the right sample tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in various settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr unlisted? free space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & edited; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image output is by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and then think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I have chosen to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibricate your monitor, since sRGB is emitting the circle. when you work as a sRGB colour space, you either need to calibrate your monitor to sRGB, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, adjusting, automatic adjustment and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Editing Automatically try out of your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the beam values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest range and a re-jibing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">If you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color White Balance.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram is shown that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and click anywhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can store in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allow you to save your settings so that you can use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called sabatier, was created when you replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically feasible. a further increase in the end creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a converted colour film made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the results and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. with large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform you can look at in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool tonality correction is set for improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool appears very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the application described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. below the graph three slide gates are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a light picture as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and reloaded later, using Gimp Levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram of red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Transition Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example for the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a picture. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is most of the time linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a ventricular arrow to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker forks and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the file system and reloaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. turn on the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam Channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color gradations.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precipitation. the left side of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with one's own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The image preview has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will appear to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. colourless is made of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel will be different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used for this purpose. you can save and load any mixer setting for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Transition Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. preserving the luminance is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford delta 100, Ilford delta 400, Ilford delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Superb</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfelter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensionality of the texture in the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the relief plot has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the confines of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your picture. the image is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), fluted with a nice three dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any place. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam template, you can apply a template through a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the stencils, a tree view appears, reflecting the folder structure of the stencil. selecting a folder automatically updates the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but created especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharper. in fact, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it does a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus and most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to blurring edges a bit blurred. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often applied for internal sharpening. in contrast images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a picture with the sharpening value. you can access this with the menu entry correction file.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should handle it carefully because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique is to re-focus the tool. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry correcting softeners and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase of the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply difference-sum. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from the sharper and therefore avoid beauty bugs in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). fuzzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected detonation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen an image & quot; refocerenquot; in which it reverses the defocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the die size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular edge or the palate. however, note that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the overlapping, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unsharp Masquerade produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Glätte knob uses the blurring of the range that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Riders and Advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mostly smoothen homogeneous regions and allow details to be sharp. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise, a high value wavy-like pattern will create. JPEG artefacts are best fixed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is traversed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step distance [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stepping focal length in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to omit it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors with lesser artefacts can be corrected. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is an odd black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy hiss that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks at the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or blackout occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or intoxicating tips can occur. place it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of phase cushioning. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high a blurring may occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected mit (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is luckily much easier than sharpening a picture. use tool for softening with the menu entry correcting softeners and experiment with the smooth. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photographic artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or later digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures are reduced to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dick-p.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right darkpicture to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and reload it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise infirming effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter. the tool vignetting correction turns the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a denial and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, tonal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value changes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The Tonnen- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction then all first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would appear to be the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cropping tool in the menu Transformative Cut out of the image processing or over the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the column-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film by the GimpGuru.org website that is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to adjust film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). check the Fill Filming option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy image specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & edited; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & edited; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooths controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch yourself.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon distortion filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving marks your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the picture here is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurring the image in the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurring the image through random shifting of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the colored basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing to keep an area free from raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the correct orientation by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the menu Transforming Turning and Transforming.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes here a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this. each stallying for photo can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blowing is very fast in what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). previewing (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save As in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relation button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data mirror the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coiling help enable you to blend aids in order for you to better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way of sharing a rectangle with similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the deckle leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & so; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates on this type a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and mirror vertices can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the default settings, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown in the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is slightly lubricated. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal pattern, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformation shear.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. previewing the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scoring, the picture is blurred. for a single shot this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scoring, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that know. this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can edit the file in image processing. you can change this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression method to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about raw image format, please refer to Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section you will find further information on using modules with & digikam..</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, soft signs, noise suppression, refocusing, unsharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform type of dialogue that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; Texture Application quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="715">The Paletten files, which are installed by & kde; can apply either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">You can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder by file.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the checkbox Beim Cursor is activated under the button Color button, the color is inserted from the color chart at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode overwrite is selected. this mode can be set by selecting the overwrite check box at Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that has been created as described in the last section, can be used together with the actions copying, cutting and pasting.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color, three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line-end sign, if another color follows. so if three numbers are stored in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="725">Graph graphics; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graph viz; includes, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kart viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraviz; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kart; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; converts the graph into & kgraphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphic viewer; in one & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphical viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graph; -Tool & dot; presupposes representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kart viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing space. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been changed by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kinkviewer; can also note your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kart viewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside a running & kart viewer; view, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kart viewer; instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. once again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Store page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program any time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the ability to set the behavior of & kviewer; specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>

<seg id="750">It produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-illuminated graphene. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm generates a springboard model for undisturbed graphs. it uses the Frudenman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-grid timer for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; & graphviz; algorithms to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module includes tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears, which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">Then the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values ductile to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the picture. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan, you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. remember that the type BMP will not compress and therefore create very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting Importing &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have picked up the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay sufficiently enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screen shot has been created, the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to the people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr may be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided by the process of generating a token. so it is used for your authentication. so it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. at present, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Open, friends and family, you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed prior to uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie-Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">Geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the image's EXIF setting, and localization may be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loads an automatic correlation which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera position. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog changes the coordinates from one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. choose the region in question and enlarge sie.Include this again and again until you have reached an adequate level of accuracy. the map can always be selected between map mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded as UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization possible.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select the albums that you want to export to HTML. you only need to select those albums. the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below, the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on an image, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permissions. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. naturally, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during production. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this is also reflected in the PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog to which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length,. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. between the individual pictures you can add a basic visual transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. afterwards, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you're planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let them black. you can define the name and path of the created file with the name of the mpeg output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the film. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start creating the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or calmly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTool and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp image processing. this is e.g.: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you often plan to edit your images or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. use this mode if you are secure, e.g. by testing in a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images in an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent. other images can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure you don't send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the emails sent. it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original exifates will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. you can close this window with the button Close.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like your slide show will be displayed. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you have to own a graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option will show that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects that you can choose from. randomly, any transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar on the upper left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation at this time. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have finished your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse and photoalbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now are present in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in this context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have proper pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify which image to display for each individual. to do this, you need to open the picture view window (described in more detail) and select the categories editor in the contextual menu. in the View window you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the lettering or description field, the labels or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may be either a part of the total file, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather try out the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start and photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry cphotoalbum; -Demo. thereupon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the website of & photoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can change between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview icon) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images. one is integrated into & photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-Example Pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file to be created on the overview page. you can find information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information being displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are exported from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any more images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set. so he can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really all are visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. so the import function, see, correctly, you will have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to go with & photoalbum; this work will not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share that file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is supposed to be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option manually copy to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most of the images were already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu file... select, will import & photoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Importing Wizard consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures you often want to jump inside different picture groups. if you want to look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps from (1) Setting information about your images, via (2) searching and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">Photoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; remembers the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically use them in future starts. if you want to read another folder in & photoalbum, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you will see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">We have described how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, e.g. objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group are set up in a group instead of explaining all groups of a group as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares its module system with other graphic applications, such as digikam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by several applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database first before using them on your own pictures. demo database can be either using the command line with the command &gt; kPhotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, which makes it possible that some modules with & photoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications don't support their pictures in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & photoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album and photoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here is a photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, it will do so, so if you would have chosen persons to view and share it with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with a photoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start and photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbum; is the possibility to comment each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image was taken. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are shown, you can, by moving the names used up, find and assign people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments for each image, you may wish to edit all selected images and provide these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multi-entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window that the USA shows as an overprint group. to show you that it is an overload, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. caution, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking and moving the groin that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the window's look to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click the Options button..., which gives you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and then window / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit selection from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use with & photoalbum; you can also use pictures without saving you on the hard drive. of course you have to save the images somewhere, so & photoalbum; you can see the view of & photoalbum; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9, so & photoalbum; you can view these images as well. you can also not view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into. & photoalbum; if you wish to avoid trouble as to avoid confusion of your images, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also trigger all the pictures that your little sister may see, and choose the menu item Everything except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will display all the images you have locked. if you want to see the images again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours about hours to describe you is of course that you want to look at it sometime. for this reason & Photo album; through a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is to be displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see, matching entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with tromb1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & photoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & photoalbum; can be changed to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom into the image and zoom out. with the mouse button, you can easily move a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed zooms, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomic operations that work in videos that come in and out are combined with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and look at other images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this picture you see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have attributes placed on your images, they are available in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, you simply put them all at once with notes. this is described in. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint pictures on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch on the painting mode of & photoalbum; switch on the painting mode from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must not fully master the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation to & Povray; should you have necessarily read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wiremodel views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting, either from the menu bar, or from the right-click context menu, you can delete previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then click on Apply or discard the changes with abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the camera and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and turning as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the passer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, drag the passer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from anchoring, drag the passer to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window order... save it. it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The Rendering icon in the toolbar, or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View Mode... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or window effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as default an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapted because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is repeatedly further divided and adaptively because the recess depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method POV-Ray uses a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, a grid of four pixel is calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of four additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">What is the difference between the two (g 1 -g 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on ittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; renders a scene. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your retention and version. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. altimeters) in the paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to those files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the Windows Type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire-model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to return.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a floor is rendered under the objects. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more details on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section, it will be explained how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector Standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Exposed window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Removing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Removing.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see the first startup of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu Edit. thus you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire-model view (bottom right). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera find. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the control point where you can change the point of the camera. just click on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button or press the input key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body header) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or the input key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now shows the plane as well, even at the moment only as a limited end-level. if you render the scene, the level stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select First Subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment is only a matt black material, because you still need to type settings for the pigment. always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumbnail. now, there are many possibilities again, but now take the simplest one.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header or the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this record twice (you can do it more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Always choose color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step as you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply) so the ball has a contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, since you have shifted the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as in the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select one color and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection effect already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have and kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the rendering of hypothetical arrows shot from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered is just a few sources of light and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Once you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently revocable command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Undo Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can modify or add new commands for & kpovmodeler with this option. modify commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any hives on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be shown either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as & amarok; -short commands. thus, make your keyboard to the & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions from the collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options from Qt and & kde; additionally Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use kdialog to make the user know why a script doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should include any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. to do this, the exec () function is mostly used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose, scripts are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to show the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackMode indicates that a new piece is being applied. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask for further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemSong path restricts the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry can be clicked. to add an entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemSong).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, cleaning up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script management can also install script packages that the user & zb; downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be detected with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the caterotation amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining loadable modules should not be executable. use the -p parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki script page by & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the amarok scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nonetheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're also searching for a certain title from thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which one you would like to hear? then the playlists browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to reexperience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources, you need to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should not have trouble compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in den & kde; mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1213">Disclosing voice files in the music files: this feature is only available when & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. if this setting is enabled .mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the & amarok preferences folder (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser from & amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you save the playlist when you exit, the current playlist will automatically save & amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, it will use & amarok; relative paths to the music files, based on the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping track of the current piece visibly causes the playlist window to open / unroll in order to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing part changes to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is applied.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & amarok; s appearance. the section is subdivided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can select the use of different fonts in & amarok; by selecting own fonts, the otherwise grey section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. press on Select..., so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of user-defined color scheme, you yourself have the source of choice and can set your own color scheme. use the color selection activated below for foreground and background color.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Setting up the OSD on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is hairy, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colours for lettering and background. clicking on the color planes will open the color selector dialog. if your own colors are not activated, the preset & kde; colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders, the OSD can be adjusted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify on which screen a multi-monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers still activate further settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that should search & amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting out how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & amarok; both the checked and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & amarok to add all the playlists found in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists then appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & amarok; under Calculator: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. then, under port: the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data required to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load card last.fm directs the support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and, if necessary, create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send the played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & amarok; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in context browsers. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & amarok; requires some of them to e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, it is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this bug to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable it if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email opens automatically with a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but not as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]); my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error while writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless the $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok will use the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug you might need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are the easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or with the developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please bear in mind that there is only one mistake there if something is related to the fixing of a bug in Amarok yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the surface intuitive, the start subwindow has been transformed into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click with the & RMBn; on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show. you can also use the Short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your choice and then select from the drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware-mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different ink (e.g. a sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does & amarok; already. don't forget that media need to be decoded first. you can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just need a white noise. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS will also decode the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less inertia react the visualisations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. if you're happy with the playlist, the tree view will only display the remaining appropriate entries. if you're happy with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the button playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have own playlists, you can add them to the playlists browser. if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format. simply drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the button playback.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make working with & amarok more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. rpm or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has & amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & amarok; a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter, it explains how all the functions of & amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bitrate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining playing time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can change through the available Analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Beneath the running text display are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used as an equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window is made up of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Playlist by & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. however, don't be deterred by the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they represent information about the current piece on each different aspect.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used previous versions of & amarok; you may notice that the subwindow is starting. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & amarok; the information can also be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz-symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded by the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended Parts, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click the text subwindow, you will try and amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which one should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com for the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interprets only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping artist / album - first the pieces will be arranged according to the artist, and there will be a further division according to the respective album. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default is 0 - albumname.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar. it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter you can find a selection box that allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours to one year. besides, you can also select your total collection, which makes the filter virtually shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - this empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Perform the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue, which will then be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">"" "transfer the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section about the Media Player Browser." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n items)... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) To move files into the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">"" "undo the compilation" "" "mark" "" "- change a copy marked as a compilation back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding artist." ""</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser designed to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also created Smart Playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Below the toolbar is a search area you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because all files are hidden in the file list, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can get music from a entered URL. if you want to enter / home / mike / musical.tar.gz for example, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop. as soon as you enter letters there, only the pieces are displayed which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by spaces, & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you type one in two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">For example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that doesn't contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the commentary bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries. entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left side, you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist. to the right, you will find Playlist Save, Playlist empty and Random Mic.</seg>

<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locking and unlocking the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible if the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the view.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature to it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. thus, the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set. to do this, system administrator privileges are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is meant for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive, which of the included programs will give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have in common all & kde; the program supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can obtain a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can be used only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void addUrls (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addUrls (Qstring path) void removeItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void setCopeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder fo</seg>
<seg id="1494">& Audiocreator; is an audio CD; a reader for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& Audiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and supported by many encoders encoding these wav files (compression-free compression). other encoders need to be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has put together a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders need to be installed. all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiver provides a small introduction about coders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio-creator; cdparanoia to read out audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. in any case, it is not possible to circumvent the copy protection mechanisms. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily use of reading a & CD is explained afterwards. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble across at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main alignment dialog of & Audiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoders, for setting up the encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that loose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important, as both codes generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'n't so 'free, lame will nevertheless be supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genuine for music of teenagers, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding explaining the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio-creator; parameters that can be used (= button of a button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs, so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer. it is important to note that this is only spoken by text: & CD; title, artist, name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator: this is meant by the author) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly on the & CD; more or less worthless so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when using freedb, the geographically closest mirrored server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution needs to be installed first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For the first opening, pre-defined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoding of the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the coding can be used. this is also required for pre-defined coders. more information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read and if both cdparanoia and audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write rights on it (eg; trying to copy something into the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & audio-creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change it in any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be passed to the selection program to read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device records for CD and CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The General Settings tab. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be notified when data for generating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during reading the & CD; the computer must be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Note that if you want to enter everything manually, deselect the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in Offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this path the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but as many firewalls work the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to send data to the freedb server. deselect the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of concurrent WAV files at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic set up of & audio creator; finished. this configuration is used as default for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, is set up in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; that is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of extracting them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, the & CD must now be pushed into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for Help in the section Questions and Answers or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window displaying, and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic request of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but collect the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Actual Title' input field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the box 'Actual Title' unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and / or file formats. see Help for the Koiler to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the tapered CD; in this example, this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information, go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. just enter the entries for the fields of the current play.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when downloading the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the BOM list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece or select the All items button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you have clicked on the selection process by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear as confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs.</seg>
<seg id="1599">"" "click on the" "" "Rider" "" "tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right below the buttons of the toolbar." ""</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the bottom left of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you are trying to work with a coder that you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this makes reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& Audiocreator; is used today within the & kde; CVS as part of the multimedia package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -Package. if you are reading this, you probably already have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is addressed to people who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs, if it is running once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many options on settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player by & kde;. in addition to others, he also has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for Gus cards. Alsa will be included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you stop playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and Gus cards (for the latter you need the lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -windows into the & kmid; windows. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press down the button down in the toolbar, select the record pick from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right side of the tempo display and change the speed of the tempo. to restore the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure affects the space bar as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in a piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again others. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not have to set anything manually. so, if you activate the Automatic Text option in the Settings menu, you will automatically select the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries of the text or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also includes the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can sum up. these are played back in line. in this section, you can see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the winnings in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. remember, if you add a lot of items.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. in turn, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the button Next, select the next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To get back a song back, select the button Previous item, the record Previous item from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but this does not matter because it is not saved when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events which the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano to events of the type Change patch to trump and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe and Gus cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. a requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another keystmap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, it is stated how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a shot (e.g. with clay 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a rifle shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note using Patch 127 (shot shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where clay means the pitch of the always same drum (as some of the keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are used primarily to map tones on the percussions-channel. watch the provided Keywords as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, you can easily do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will need to be defined in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch 'option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitchBenderRatio indicates, in what ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI Settings. these can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which tones are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights up no more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view in the Settings menu, under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to solve the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, that's why & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so set automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then includes exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this animated me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a little bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great pleasure to send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends of & kmid; however, before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my free time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I'm only getting more programmed because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error message or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile and compile using the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD's or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; has not been finished as & kde; it was installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, then you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical level. if you click an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' news item ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not run. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 oblast option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / introver.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format needs to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would be disturbing during the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; bodysuit; & lt; img dur = "inverter; / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet"; & lt; / smilgt; In the source package of & KMPlayer; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tabs for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special embed field for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be returned in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Zuordinances of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be launched in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To make a given back end for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be detected. the code to use must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints on how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is root after inserting the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does every time my CPU must be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhaud. kxineplayer automatically takes the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the actual output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and when clicked on an element in the DVI; file is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text has been clicked, the corresponding passage in the DVI file is speckled.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quickset: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is applied on "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick assembly." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick classification of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop-down selector can be used to add items such as keywords, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, an image or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice of a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary inclusions. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is related to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ e. e is used for setting the font sizes. it can be set the font sizes for the main text, the notes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and defining the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ Documclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font sizes. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ Building or the button of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for the errors in the logging process. when using a quick installation & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few acid should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows the change of font sizes within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only considered within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language has been presented, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better legibility of the document. at least a quote, a few places in the bold and italics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format (English D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed (in the viewer) by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can start using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, just set up Modern under Settings Kile... Tools Building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for a pre-select search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on pre-select. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okularline; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the & DVI file doesn't open, an error can be found. if there is an error, it will be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source of errors in the source code. in the editor, the buttons of the LaTeX errors and the LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. to view the error line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the error line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting Empty document, a document can either be rewritten from the ground or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created in & boxes; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selection of file templates... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings Generate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it, and to know its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands in & latex; use and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with a marked Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a click switch, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can add additional hock marks. this is a unique type of bookmark within the text. the MenÃ ¼ tEdit bounce marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump-mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically cleared when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile;. although & quot; provides excellent opportunities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This augmented meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bent thing in & box; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command will also select & latex; commands with a back tag (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For creating a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Placards; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands here for a quicker possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit Deselect paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for more commands under the editing environment for a more convenient work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the\\ begin {setting} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the most recently opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the cursor clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; group #, the other end of the group jumps (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a number of nested groups braces, the overview can be lost quickly. this command will close the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used in & boxes; the character "is used for two simple quotes. also for ending the request the character is" used. & Kile; knows this case and holds two enclosing quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. nannic or French) and with it German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When you click Shift; enter & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & lt; not only a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment: the current line with\\\\ with an ending line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; Set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby arrange all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to make this possible. in case of the next tabulator in the underlying line. although this tabulator may not be the corresponding table, add & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current table.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & quot; already has a good source code completion, this has been extended in & Kile; in order to add special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are equipped for automatic processing. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Kile... Completely adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment by the command\\ begin {surround}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surrounding} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the back button is at the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and the result list may be altered. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, the hooks can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by working with the NÃ ¤kest jumping-mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Components can be made to these lists. there can be different lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as widening of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for completion of environments. there must always be a couple of letters with\\ begin to be entered and a full list of environment commands will result. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for upgrading the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When you call the dialog box over the volume processing environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically opened and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient charge can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & boxes; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Components can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of changes to be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile Complete. as an example of a cooling list, the example.cwl file, for example, is included in the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word modifies mode over the volume processing, or the key Ctrl + Alt Memory button, the letter L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large windows are not helpful for automatic processing. however, it has been established that many converts can be written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings box... Kile Complete shields can be deactivated. here, the threshold value for displaying the full charge can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the Personal Home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages with a few & PostScript; tools can be rearranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the outcome of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in groups to compile compiling, creating and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers like & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used by the key Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be used in the default viewer by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When the command is used, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer should be used, a new window will open each time.</seg>

<seg id="1918">This application expects index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in the root folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of the current working folder and enter the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time meinproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, everyone who has worked on the & kde; documentation already knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; is there a great graphical interface for that now.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the opened file is index.docbook, then simply select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an issue on the screen, your file is flawed. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be reviewed is already selected in & quantaplus, then let the current file be clicked. if not, delete the file and select the file to be reviewed by means of other file - file selection.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; lends, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little do. thus, the plug-in system will benefit very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until somebody builds up in & quantaplus; the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a Kpart, we start editing the Plugins menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location used & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something special happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that will insert a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">You can either select the comment entry from the Editor's context menu or add the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Note can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the specified nickname of the team member, is part of the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive regardless of upper or lower case, but spaces around the brackets and: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the settings menu. here only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta. this dialog extends over several pages, which are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">"" "large / Small writing of tags: large / lowercase of automatically added tags. normal" "" "bulk" "" "means the tags are inserted in the same way they are described in the tagXML files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Small case of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in the same way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if selected, is inserted for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically include tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and finish day: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default preferences can be restored using button Standard.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file opening opened files (where the coding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is affected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; produces regularly backup copies so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when starting the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documentation can be previewed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful if the user interface has perched through changes of MDI modes and andocken / append of views. it is equivalent to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable warnings from non-refundable warnings.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the syncing behavior of the VPL- and the source view in split mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Adjustment tab, the visibility of knots in the tree, the editable frequency of the tree when editing, and how deeply when changing the structure tree is to be automatically opened. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each one can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause Abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are KPart-applications from the third side, which can be reused by any KPARK-capable application, the best-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in, if it is not located on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read Only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-read-kParts only refuse the load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the given information is correct. select allows saving the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely new. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable Debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed, with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that you don't have to pay attention to it normally.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger's session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the sounds according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to deport a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script without passing information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger implements the next instruction in the script, where possible, if possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if the current does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a front end and a part of xsldbg which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they allow & quantaplus; abilities such as car completion and node trees. their simplicity and flexibility make from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tags & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. tool lists are handy, symbolic grosts of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the descriptive language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than the only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the Tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag, which is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Gives the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to reach the source of the data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but make sure & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; start window and select TagXML. another dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the verification takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a file descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a new file descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = reference 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"" "an action can be set with Settings" "" "actions..." "". "click New Action for the same dialog:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. clicking on the User Defines button can be assigned a shortcut; with K1, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the detailiated settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples of & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / mysq.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript t.sh. This allows you to find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in the case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be used. input can be determined in the input field, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages sent to the default output. it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the default output by setting the output selector output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the cup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit tag," if available so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should note the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called loose, started, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -Tag in the current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar and set the toolbar dialog. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save in the correct folder. after it does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please fit your & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2, # Section1.html Securities</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, now see the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = indeduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax = language.basic syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequentially at the top end of tree view & mdash; folders are shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file attachment lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use the & quantaplus; -Repository for using the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), send tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a final contribution, we recommend to sign the resources, for which there is a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; it can be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions Line: the string that appears in! Doctype day, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are a number of key concepts. in order to understand them and to make full use of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only be used by the user themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emogliges the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of a number of main areas: the editing pane, the tree views, the tab pages with information and toolbars. please check in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the editor area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse-cursor, help to the word under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string under the mouse pointer is a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as the default for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; PGT; insert into your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow access to information on & quantaplus; navigate, open them and strip them. in the presentation with carabaries stand for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right-click. actions such as add, remove, upload, or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. click with the left mouse button to call the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshes the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can change attributes and namespaces. the application system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab at the bottom end of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and any changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all bugs in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are any) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to change the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him an absolutely great Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly turned into a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see the section on templates. if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"" "when pasting from the clipboard there are special characters" "" "HTML" "", "so they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard into & URL; enrolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces into & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch on / off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes straight to a line number. this is very helpful if you run & PHP; -script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of the script and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Start-up of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be added by setting actions. toolbars are saved by Toolbars Toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or anyone else made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities of the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu default in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current date settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the following.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-ending identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instantaneous switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or unattractive graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or subwindow mode, representing the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Turn off the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbars or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should best be completed from top to bottom, because, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be set with Shift; F7 Project Properties later.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote machine, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars as standard. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local file system to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change. with server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Allow files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder, and you can select an accurate selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or by using the Shift; F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations, such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignors, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plug-in can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, high-layer profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by holding its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, modified or deleted. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files are found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are as well, but the entries are missing Open and Open with... in the context menu which can be accessed using the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forget about program ends. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk do not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-level profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & ftp;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it is not easy to read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, that is, by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "views can be stored, opened or deleted in the" "" "Project" "" "menu or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings" "" "Toolbars Project Toolbar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus, to their own mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best designed using the toolbar menu. the use and addition differ. adding tool bars is discussed below in the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be removed, toolbars can be changed, or toolbars can be set, which actions should be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set actions to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; models supplied have conditions for their deployment. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents are nested in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see the template tree for more information.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to your preference (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File as Template Save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File as Template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Conqueror's file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click on a folder to the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can give headers and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; create, insert files or associate with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify a folder's behavior, right-click on the folder and select properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts to everything except the regular folders in the template list. if a root folder would be set so, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This may be common headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers by copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a full command collection for adding or copying and pasting templates from one place to another using the context menu (press the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source Editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit, it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchron. pressing F9 will activate this mode, if this mode is already active, the keystroke moves the active cursor from one window to another, with the position in the document maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is configurable via Settings Quanta.... By choosing VPL; -view one can choose between synchronization after a click or automatic. in principle, the recommendation: a small gap for fast computers and a large gap for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Let's assume that you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of unseen tags is possible when working with the VPL; -Editor. the document property dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the severing encoding.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned and kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the merge-editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can view this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance when someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both distinguish files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, you can make typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 folders 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manually typing file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will remember your selection and display it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in Open dialog, you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large amount of effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing out of & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interprete the dragging and inserting text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a little help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the abstracting column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file does not have rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the title output:, the filename and [Changes] if you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also result in a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane, and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting sources ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate will mainly use the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, page up, end, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the release window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if this is enabled, it is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. but be careful with this option because you may accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying OS. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart run + newline feed\\ r\. KDiff3 doesn't keep the line end of the source files, so you should also not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the shutdown and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KEx3 Set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the selected font doesn't support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered scanned. on these systems, the default settings will automatically display an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selector is automatically copied to the clipboard. then the manual copy to the clipboard is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Comparing files try & kdiff3; first, to find all fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, while others save only a newline '\'. if this option is enabled, the return marks are made visible, but they may be disabled as a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details under documentation about the directory comparison and merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to quit & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is controlled globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for the coding, a short note of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (e.g. your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply skip the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When you read a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only with the line-up command. you can write your own preprocessor which meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff-results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they're very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in feature in KPhrase. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line abys. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, i.e. virtually erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the composition. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something else such as perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details differently. where used\\ (and\\), perl only needs (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete files recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merge. to start merging, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the folder scan, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case, the join action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. for folders, age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B one file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B one file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active, if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option synchronizes directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B; directly after merging is copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge selection (unsure) is enabled, then investigates & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging a file is executed after the other. it status column displays fervently when merging was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full analysis, Kdiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odd), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you haven't specified a destination folder, C is used as a target in the Three-Folder merge mode, B is chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select Start / Continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only merge the current entry: execute Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options passing, simulating and disconnecting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you only want to see what would happen without making any changes, then you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, choose start / resume root directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next record.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you breach the merge (F7 key), a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them at the later merging of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set Settings - &gt; KPhr3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. more than one pattern can be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree. more than one pattern can be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders about a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the modification date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, if the modified date has been lost when copying.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it will not change the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view will be visible to the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can split the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file with double-click. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without first having the folder merge. to do this, the status will be set to default and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # file has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, permissions or modification date vary from the original. (note the option Confidential of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently seen as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts at first the built-in difference viewer. to start KEx3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KPhrase Show from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a Koot, & kdiff3; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KPhrase Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in Part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KEx2 (now it is Compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KEx3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff3 program from the Diff-Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, no src is left; no src is left, and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses a lot of colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and mismissing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KEx3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copy into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This will also cause identical files when merging will not be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, Windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries pager... and ending. if however, on an application inside & Kpager; clicked, the icon and name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Bedding.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, the name of the virtual workspace will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of the virtual worktops. if it is ticked together with the name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & pager; otherwise only empty working surfaces will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & pager; the main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN grid appear, as out of pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual worktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini utility in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & pager; and then set up switch settings... the dialog provides settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the package kdebase, you will need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & Kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the magnified area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is a magnified area of the screen and is referred to below as a select window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default, you can magnify & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a moving loupe. alternatively, you can set up a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select screen mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard knot; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection box to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are using the & Shift; button or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection box. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is stuck and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it into the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop updating of the ad. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against zero.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (with the button Document recharge in & konqueror;), Enlarge and Cut & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen magnifier; you can use a magnifier to increase the screen size in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligent shifting is enabled, the shooting time is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait until the mouse button is released when no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click with mouse shift. if this feature is activated, a slow move moves to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears, you can and kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the tab General. there's a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the user's last pushing back.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you get used to the automatic mouseclick, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of the position of a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to figure out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when an imposition has just begun. if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keypad. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to select text to copy it into the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: hold a mouse click at an end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, each time & kmousetool is played; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when smart move the shifting time. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xreview extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; selects the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer passes. this program was designed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and cause pain to antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to make a certain amount of time waiting for a drag process to begin before the mouse button is released. this way you can drag and drop with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2625">News has the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you read & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can with & kmouth; anyone who just enters the room. & kmouth; -Notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you get from the carp card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are executed in queue, except for Screen reavers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reader reads, this output is halted and terminated.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with predefined string replacement filters, which enable the replacement of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the reformat of messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the speaker card, you can read text from KDE messages.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will continue to be modified to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notifications on & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. editing through the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample for the set of string replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as desired, it only has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; -conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile it, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer), including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source archive for kdegg or downloaded the recently created tarball, please compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, first check if the speech synthesizer works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that uses the program speech dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be further developed that the device of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can go back to sentence or reject sentences, repeat, pause or cancel output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker, whose language English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the Spokesperson Spokesperson to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the Vocabulary Book Spokesperson device will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the Festival. in Voices, the & ktts; known, this setting will be done automatically. generally speaking, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider controls you adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some regulators and display this grey, the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click on Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed kttsmgr at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the icon kttsmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not yet run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD is reading a text.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application set up the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently processed set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the tab narrator.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes to the settings (also on the other flashcards) will be taken over and deskttsmgr becomes a symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKoen, click on the audio card audio. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Here, only text orders are listed and managed. issues of screen readers, warnings and messages are not displayed. for more information on the message types of & ktts, see.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for the audio output, select the audio output. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you chose ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 50bsp;% corresponds to about half and 200nbsp;% about twice the normal speech speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the running & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you will have to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this tab you can set up special actions which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News has the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that suggests news. if you've just read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the space.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, it adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, alerts and the expenditure of screen reavers there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; to read Knotfy messages, run kttsmgr and click alerts. the flashcard notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Tick this check box to turn on & kde; Notice Notice. if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played will be rejected by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events from the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event will read the message, the & conversation; sends whenever someone in an IRC message mentions your nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down selector to specify what & ktts; do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected a user-defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the properties of the speaker you want. default selects the speaker that appears as the top entry in the list on the tab. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the application default (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. you can set the default notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications to a file. use the button load to load saved settings from a file. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except All notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently it supports & ktts; the SSml only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default voice used to the festival in the issue of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch are not set in the festival configuration dialog, the SSml-text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;!

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limit detection filters (SDB filters). thus & ktts; faster with advance reading, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-limit detection filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set limit detection filters, but beginners are advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn pronunciation is to try out the language selection. switch on the selection of speakers and select text to read. switch back the subscriber selection, change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changing.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the preview can start, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter will be automatically set up if you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit detection filters match text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) at the set boundaries (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; -News (knotify), warnings, messages or the issue of Screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit filter, you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Speaker Selection tab, you can overwrite subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the tab narrator). in other words, no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & tt; otherwise select & tts; the speaker that most likely matches the originally set-up features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this property doesn't matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as the primary property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case that you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is terminated. probably you have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, you may have a non compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I get a text order, it freezes and ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is a problem that conflicts occur in ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an extra voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. as a guide you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer moduls such as Festival Interactive offer themselves a setting for speed on the cartridge card for speaking device. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; prereads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml;) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml reforming filter, and set up the talk speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't want web pages to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female Festival orator, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that Festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file throws to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a proprietary string replacement filter and now I can work in & ktts; no more set-wise pre- or backward. on the tab jobs it is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for punctuation recognition for these characters.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by running GStreamer in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you stop a text order and then launch another one. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKoen does not support any real pauses. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of speaking speed but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can also install apt-get install sox. the program is already included on most & linux; -CDs already.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have & ktts; as tarball (tar-packed archive), log in as normal users and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to Debian distribution guidelines).</seg>
<seg id="2765">Set in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as an option --prefix = destination. for example</seg>
<seg id="2766">On Debian systems, / usr / local is the proper folder for programs that are translated from the sources.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Do not install the make -f Makefile.cvs CD-f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you & ktts; use, check first whether your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help with this find in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in the festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8 bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this creates the audio output. & MBROLA; -program and & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete voice output system. & MBROLA; generates speech from phone files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. txt2pho can also create Diphone from German lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional wrapper code is added to the Festival to use & MBROLA; -voice files for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in & MBROLA; -folders, but in the folder festival / lib /.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German & MBROLA; required is either festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from</seg>
<seg id="2780">Instructions can be found in the file README in the package you downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0, the error correction is not required, you only need to recompile the Festival). then insert the following lines into the file festival / lib / sitemit.scm.</seg>

<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selection of K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and enables the setting of the network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose from which the distribution and the release stick is best. by selecting the setting non-again the setting can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will then set this selection automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are shown in grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you will enter system management mode at the right bottom end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode all functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">When selecting Automatically, TCP / IP settings are retrieved from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected in the selection list according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be turned on or off as required. switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>

<seg id="2818">Establishes the IP address of the computer in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name to an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons, or Herunter in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine for name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list Namingly known computers describes the hostname-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting if no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list Namingly contains well-known computers some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the review will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the well known computer has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit hosts will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in one & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface, such as kpackage or the installation tool for its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile / knetwork.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second section all of the & knetworkconf parameters are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section may not replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found any major spread. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in alien networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is used or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks we mostly use addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0g; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = one's own host).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first consisted of creating a surface for tar, which also offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be involved in & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; hars the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. does not recognize & kdat; the preload on the band does not, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">When you recognize & kdat; the preload, it searches for the right index on your disk. can this not be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives by a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a member of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted from the tape. floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, it continues & kdat; with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can check your selection once and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the verification of the verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate remanufacturing, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for Restore. in this dialog, you can check your selection once and change the workfolder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you confirm the restore settings dialog, the dialog appears again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the strip file using the band content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can recreate the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be stored is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the other files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & quot; & lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Before the tape is involved, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejected at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat is activated when releasing & kdat; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with floppy-streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a system log viewer. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. it will not appear to you, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log directory, for which ordinary users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings. the list of the log rows is now automatically changed, so only log lines will be displayed. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">For example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log, so & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. transcript lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color than protocol lines of the level hint. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "in addition, you can enable" "" "Add to new lines" "" "in the main window context menu to display all new transcript rows." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org you will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly becomes the standard for the control of program starts when running the system in der & Linux; world. and that is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. so you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or when switching to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls go to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when driving.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-set runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can modify / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have done something, then you come to repair it by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the proper scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start (or stop it) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts from Runleveling or change the position within a level by relocating it elsewhere. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original RunLevel (or its position). this will not happen unless you pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sortia of the surrounding entries, before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run run run X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) use, you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without a message if their configuration files are not installed or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaption of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry of the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only shown if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled default restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created, where you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management tab appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable from the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). parameters can be modified for each user, with the limited space limitations in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups tab informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group belonging to the user can be found in the Primaries Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user group or group or click on the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
