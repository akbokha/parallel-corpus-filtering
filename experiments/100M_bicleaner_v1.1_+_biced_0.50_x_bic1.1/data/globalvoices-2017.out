although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I also grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges , who were interested in his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never holds behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in favour of him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever reached by a nom@@ ine@@ e nom@@ ine@@ e from the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ ump Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also agreed with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
s@@ ling@@ erie intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who spent her life fighting the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ co , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the Pres@@ i@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
dealing with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tors as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are aware of , have voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note : white against all other ethnic groups ) ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash play on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one likes to have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump@@ ings , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at rest , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan included the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump@@ y Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan might find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image by Fli@@ ckr user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and a musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa visited .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law bur@@ gl@@ ar of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to refu@@ te one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier members from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and interact with each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ating existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail &apos;s pace with information between individual countries , the actions are happening today in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that were noted or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worth financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million lost in lost revenue which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year lose due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world , including those illegal fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inary names , fishing @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamlessly organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must@@ n &apos;t run my harbour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close the F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has so far been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more accurately .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we are trying to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support .
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information with each other . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations indeed influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed through the position of every single track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and gather their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now account for a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we are now also copying other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; with certainty , the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only the ship was on the go without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is spreading further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s inaugur@@ ation .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continually deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition looked at the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the demonstr@@ ators decided to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly following the 2015 elections , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country@@ wide civil stri@@ pe and on November 3 all went to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :

meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that trains the scale of repression per day :

this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was OK .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department of 141 at La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
of the archive .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there , I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
don &apos;t be careful that they don &apos;t lead you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la four times - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch where men were tortured .
it looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone to harm another person so much ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I was aware that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were band@@ aged .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people cau@@ ti@@ ously on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was aware that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and they were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be la@@ yed .
this was the lie - euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges that are taken off by an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and carry you on your own hands .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless made clothes with us .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the enforced disappearance of cor@@ pse is the last des@@ pic@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have , therefore , executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
you could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the enforced disappearance of cor@@ pse is the last des@@ pic@@ able act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machinery to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is always something that remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I made alle@@ gations of all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 , still under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death row in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentences in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been witnessed , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ it@@ ances .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .

edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a particularly failed translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ling@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was fal@@ sely translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and is simply unacceptable in an international city such as Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was removed first . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt insul@@ ted by insufficient correc@@ tions ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News explained something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved in accidents nationwide , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased during the same period .
the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers :
the article on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How faulty is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
a French native speaker should , for example , translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could translate into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost accounting or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious phrases created by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace human translators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no longer accessible .
other online channels supported recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was cli@@ pped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology by which the DNS servers answer certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds in@@ correctly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was broadcast on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ A c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who handed over the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ min@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ min@@ tas as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ min@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ rides their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children do not have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a treaty that one cannot lift .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ min@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ min@@ ta generally remains silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon happened in the bor@@ ro@@ gens in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent strokes . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was the home of the former military unit Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ min@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest meetings and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ays story a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ min@@ ta
the Cri@@ min@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to en@@ rol and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ min@@ ta .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library than food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the owner of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read an editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would be able to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
but she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing almost never talked about is mo@@ bbing and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ min@@ tas are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ min@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay .
the Administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
starting Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a five year old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland wanted to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author once again switched to the display :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ min@@ ta , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ li@@ do ?
( Cri@@ min@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guaran@@ Ã­ ) and the indigenous population of Paraguay .
social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ om@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
released under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian members of Parliament recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations on the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragraph and cur@@ ses in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video directing and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not give any indication of how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technical University ( senior research scientist ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly controlling physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and that no different nar@@ ration is present on the scene , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those convic@@ ted was found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian leop@@ ard in the war drawn from war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which stre@@ ak through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain type of Leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore stipul@@ ates that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia .
his works have been published in numerous international publications , including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .
Meyer has made films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and H@@ BO .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbors Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared whole coastal towns off the map .
to do this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had an atomic accident , already alone for this reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after that to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings ( for the most part ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , it is still hard to reloc@@ ate the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters into final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , still 36@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the 2011 Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated persons resi@@ ding in homes after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors again until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to make a living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated . she questioned her about the status of re@@ building and how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has intensified their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
160@@ ,000 ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated almost 63 thousand people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were over 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
after the stand of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people who are still living in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how love for music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer had attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s conf@@ essed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer were beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and all the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bing shortly afterwards hurry to him .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo So@@ ell@@ ado calls on further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a punch stick .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , requested the police to for@@ go violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media fal@@ si@@ fied street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on the course of confrontation with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk church Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after that , the sugar cane industry was still standing still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stops every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation again after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality looked for better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , got their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closing of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all those sur@@ vey@@ ed agree that not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of Pentecost , the first letters began .
it was officially written documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was passed on and the letters were more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the down@@ turn of the factory in which he was built .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work@@ sheet ist was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other firms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were replaced with spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they &apos;ve been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years old in retirement , not because it lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this with hip hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb &apos;s First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , in spite of the influence of globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters did not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the youngsters involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available , as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if none of you are interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also advance our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the creator .
in the commentary , the reader and advocate of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ lement ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most part ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plasma models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
there are a variety of these small companies in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile tel@@ eph@@ ones decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an Em@@ press @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone alive :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing rush into the comic .
some Handy stand and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and Lach@@ s@@ ammed are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself .
reporting about drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; Living with Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers , and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who secre@@ tes secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not get it out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; fe@@ ats &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; in this she describes how an armed det@@ ective month paid money from their business for month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 initiated the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words un@@ true
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages he links to include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images for news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became a dangerous path full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck was killed .
officials described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie theater in the neighbourhood full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ tered bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned beyond recognition .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ gu@@ r @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident are the atro@@ cious scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were chopped , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated graphi@@ cally .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria &apos;s military and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here again the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ quot@@ ations ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a Blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page which 2012 fal@@ sely claimed , the president Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original article , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false statements
traces of these false hu@@ gs go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are indeed coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the shown picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose counter@@ fei@@ ts .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked it to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage can be found from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been inter@@ connected ) .
here are some cases which can now be detected completely ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false copies of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available about Tin@@ Eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , which expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ ri@@ gate the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used for mis@@ use .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpos@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos that came from international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ruling , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims that Christians kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein said in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Katho@@ lische related news site An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ Fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the image of the DR Congo , fitted with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , launched a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it ho@@ ax .
from the message containing the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated himself .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also indic@@ table , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original turn of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or , for the defence of Muslims , the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
is this mood of mis@@ information and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been discussed extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be solved by the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. conf@@ using ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ gi@@ a ) .
but they all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s sales @-@ lap , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Reg@@ arding your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ et language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they determined other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite characters here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement from the disaster release of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people were missed due to floods and mud waves .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations .
the rain@@ falls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are ag@@ grav@@ ating the crisis of the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ all are on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a flooded the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a water level .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are being completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and startups have also agreed to help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential nutrients for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ b@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this field .
the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water help &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button that resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance .
this prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her four years old daughter ; she trusted in her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first minute we are calling even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one , we are pushing rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman wearing head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they have muscular pains .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion in different ways .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there are Muslim .
to be de @-@ ci@@ li@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was a orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dis@@ rupt it .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries over the past three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who are moving movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans that had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1,7 billion Nar@@ rati@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims find the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were Muslims and Americans .
but am I now the Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ ingly jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam hostili@@ ty machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and counter@@ f@@ eit experts who have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole U.S. , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ugly forms acc@@ uses our affili@@ ation .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered to her the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as she was winning a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I shall see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that , over centuries , has been col@@ oni@@ alized by an empire , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only master .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
meanwhile , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an inv@@ aded his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history has been dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was den@@ oted by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops distributed across each continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is hiding the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that a African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion presents more possibilities than a cube , but is portrayed in the reducing two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its boundaries vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ding it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we are leading and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ ed to un@@ veil the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we are perpet@@ u@@ ating in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim cre@@ ators and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage by the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given it ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ disputed Muslim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that I have left in my speech here as a bread cro@@ oked track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections our humanity constitutes , a story may lie in where someone is made to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations took place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mi@@ sts talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools for us or that we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination have been enth@@ ron@@ ed even more than four decades ago , even the science of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake feeds , while he already en@@ ra@@ ges cap@@ ut@@ ated countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity
tell stories , by Fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now , despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) Initiative , counting stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often to it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to listening in order to appreciate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will present their history first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also took the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical of their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers are hoping to expand this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico requests from the US to re@@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civi@@ c organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April , 2017 . the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ constitution of debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government bodies responsible for debts are accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests on public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on political responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
Puerto Rico &apos;s economic and financial crisis requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , the measures imposed from the outside will risk being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration bore the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist from the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , produced excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book published last year and available here roy@@ alty free contains a number of es@@ says dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the moti@@ ons for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , immediately .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of periodi@@ cally extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of B@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ pi@@ tious than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ road of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
iron@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ stitute , which she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was det@@ ained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the memory of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our call in the hope we have to do for the last time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corruption @-@ driven director to release after release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique strongly re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants because of the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic that evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to rel@@ inqu@@ ish his old post , as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good .
the Center for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the Director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression in terms of the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have had a disciplinary action against the acc@@ ru@@ al .
the company seemed to be silent , however , and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dispro@@ portion@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
consequently , it is obvious that Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no moral authority :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the State because he insul@@ ted it . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks moral returns to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so re@@ warding .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , ed@@ ging and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaking or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he firmly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down for 10 years and was free .
and today , the company , in which he frau@@ ds mon@@ ies , sets him back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î¹@@ hypertension ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or chips . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the familiar social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general used as an ad@@ j@@ ective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese script &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely de@@ ar@@ ming con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the use of the word were cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before any posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ ebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( split@@ ters ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author wrote his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic cens@@ orship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out whether Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control susp@@ icious hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context than focused on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ days are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously passed a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members adher@@ ed to du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a great public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ch Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 per cent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were trying to create laws for children &apos;s to@@ e followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually un@@ complicated situation , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s to@@ e was adopted - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law announce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m once more :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single vote against it .
after having previously agreed in the Senate , the draft law can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial authority in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that we@@ ars the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the law has been decre@@ ed .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the law of marriage was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed to the law voted for the law .
the to@@ days are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought it out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj had announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to now promise his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem that we , the state in our bedrooms , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters in front of them , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the cache they remained .

on Sunday morning , the Office of Public Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dim .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are fighting against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using re@@ taining tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the best @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator @-@ machine @-@ connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is accessible , despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all made it possible to take sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alised and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ti@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ ck@@ ling rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and its hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers it the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .

my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already face to face to Tig@@ ers :

also I was on the way home due to the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ zz@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to make pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ tim@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India it avoids women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of an illu@@ sion@@ ary court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and community , after having appe@@ aled to a married relative with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far less rebu@@ ke to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as child marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected individuals , and heads these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
the name of their hus@@ bands does not say lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to test at home as she is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this confidence in their luggage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was ch@@ oked only in front of him ; another decided to let the whole fru@@ stration of him and his family go out by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about breaking with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the hall@@ mark @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the husband :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of debate and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini also smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion of the discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , still make it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling about more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag &quot; b@@ ash@@ tag &quot; was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . in the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch just survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on should represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you must definitely visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly this day in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan community in market terms , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to go .
so , we hope you are there !
this is followed by the h@@ ash@@ tag of the b@@ ash@@ tag of ancient times , to find out more about the Beat@@ les memorial day .
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of ab@@ duction of bald @-@ headed persons for the organ trade , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , al@@ armed the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs were used by sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there was the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could disclose gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC reported .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel in Mozambique to Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ bra in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and killing of individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that there exist a faith according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha gave on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE SA@@ ME fo@@ ams a country in which people would have shame to offer sex against good marks , and others who would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which people would not still bald or bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ app@@ et , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald faced :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ tion &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death but gave no further information .
Bas@@ el &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 1 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a was told by Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we prove that Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the Open Web movement is the honour .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , according to the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , po@@ den@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told me that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she shared in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to aboli@@ sh all the limitations of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy asked for a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible statements on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to impose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Germany - Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ ti@@ ces surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak and contact with anyone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for exercising these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where it is needed . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed in an explanation on June 28 about Li@@ u very concerned and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellbeing .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore is Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is internationally recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of it , he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco and New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ ric emerges from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he addressed the relevant questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he suggests that you should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as the leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right associated and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore come back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet , statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why does the people of Singapur perform their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel selection ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence of the country first of all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world are revealed and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that Canadi@@ ans are different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadian Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , however , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ les on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , we often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if one would conf@@ use me to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ e@@ worthy - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada is truly a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have a personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background un@@ noticed , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau visited the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ding Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video , par@@ o@@ ding the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who talks about what regulations his girlfriend is doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was split 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the state of the country under the rule of the jun@@ ta .
take a look at these photos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that have per@@ sever@@ ed in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which provides absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content was monitored and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy were prosec@@ uted .
Thailand pursu@@ es a strict verdict against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este . &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the Ghost T@@ owns in Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in east @-@ west Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Libyan war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ ths , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and the rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people are in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , stand for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native old man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ow@@ kas , which house one or two families , can be seen on balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration offers candles and bread for free at the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost their anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all were living as it was right for them .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides himself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that will ensure that they live in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border between Mexico and Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain locations are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outdoors on car@@ tons .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian belief is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ et .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers check their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who left .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves with many photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her in a short time .
&quot; Ya &apos;s fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time .
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities refused to use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police report , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking porn websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites , to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the East and South , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( ... ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ leep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all the glory of their name .
one that has put down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters become transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth continues on the axis of the un@@ holy . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of security posts formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
all the bor@@ ou@@ ghs desired , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply in the district stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we turned to a glorious picture that fully fulfilled my expectations .
at such a moment you become aware that you fre@@ eing the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me also hear you scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to sh@@ out when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were shining upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sad to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you forgot my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest chat that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal to his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this accur@@ sed sentence is in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I know all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately place myself without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ time communication method : to beat with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ onder@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there are no markings on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will interro@@ gate immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars and li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these crow@@ s that are lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played out their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I supervised the interro@@ gation chamber and met Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start with your life much more important than join you and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become accustomed to not answering .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become a common means of communication for me after a friendly chat .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ ams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry did not yet fall to him enough , why they exchanged the reed with a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity went through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , this was my only option .
some hours passed , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of speech and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he loops on his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for the past six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her tried and tested views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities , ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation &quot; - he den@@ otes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he poured Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the dra@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when looking into neighbouring countries .
from this point on , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert cancellation .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been canc@@ eled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who continued to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a well @-@ worn unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the official extern@@ ally left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 Anti @-@ Crime Act , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not shy away from subjects that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been fed up to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notes that hardly anybody in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b appeals to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they were critical in social media comments critically related to the problems rooted in the country &apos;s deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes .
finally , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes .
as far as it is concerned , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the trucks , the drums and the dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we had a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro G@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two trucks are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend your summer :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate job like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ paralleled demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy &apos;s school , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in hair arts instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year starting in March , the school provided special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
used with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who are ej@@ ecting affection ?
exactly this question came from the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga of the Bo@@ got@@ kind Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la ll@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as letters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock wore their weapons , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - who will then be personally handed over .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC warri@@ ors who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia including Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation travelled to the camp to personally deliver the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they didn &apos;t receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; explains the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I looked into one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as live ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already there was war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people , who have never heard heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters reply to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were made aware that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to take arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hor@@ r@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs above the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not come about overnight .
OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published , which address the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ecting susp@@ icious que@@ ens and det@@ ained them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
as she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender balance of their country@@ men , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she ultimately moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was busy picking up some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had provided everything and began scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab in my right lung .
OC Media : in which parts of the hospital were you placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some totally unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by walking up the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster that has not only damaged your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and rescu@@ ed them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registration , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; don &apos;t you think you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the # 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I desire , I can &apos;t overcome this emotional barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not complete a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but purpos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was involved when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports until now . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Great ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the seri@@ ousness of it !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was true , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to approach us originally to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilians &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had coloured eyel@@ ashes , bore tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never bent a hair on me .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when people laugh at the sick .
OC Media : so they just opened their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but above all about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I felt the situation in the Republic was steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I sli@@ pped the shelter .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you clear with fr@@ oth in front of your mouth , that there are no gay men with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ gs have which , the Cab@@ ar@@ ins have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
know , many think about transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there is a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment , entered the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed themselves .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable uses for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
unemployment rate among Arab A@@ haw@@ ks rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans coming from Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ el@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women , especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists , react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the Movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same education than men .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling in different areas of life sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we face black women in two @-@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration backgrounds often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a degra@@ ding and margin@@ alized being in historical regard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to completely remove myself from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that affects the black woman .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am being recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and for my being as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flower in an environment where my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Chair . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman reported Bal@@ bu@@ ena on account of abuse , the A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos; ac@@ lod@@ ged ad@@ vert was of no use .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women generally report an advertisement , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , the women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must first report to the law enforcement authorities .
contents 1 put@@ ts and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that nothing under par with Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate execution blows and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General claimed 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of advertisements in police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of 2014 , two women who are unable to do so come to each woman who will be ref@@ unded due to physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s hom@@ icide is not a criminal off@@ ender in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately demonstrate how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I never thought that I would become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it happened only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with mental abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ tori@@ an ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an opa@@ que legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fear@@ ing ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law prescri@@ bes to explain Fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also gain members of the law that advoc@@ ates the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment .
the original draft law had envis@@ aged the bulk of ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply want to report a complaint and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that the partners in cases called for domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
the opinions on the changes are taking place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconciliation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media launched in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for reporting corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but later released .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , besides his role as the only Sultan , the chief ministers in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , to restrict public freedom , including freedom of the press , and to torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces took I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied to the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it was about corruption in judicial system and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged in front of the Special Affairs Committee and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited by any means , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , abuse of the Internet and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ence of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 denom@@ inated Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year ban on professional charges against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic rival ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i acqu@@ itted the appeals court on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remained in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; closure by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ der their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including court ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is made with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I recently started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
Q : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make available to pay ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ aded Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents used not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or gre@@ y@@ ish or cra@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and car@@ rots . because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton still breeds a salad ; however , it needs longer since its work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to commu@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far to salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing in the United States and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS raised and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ sh@@ aded grape variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT domain and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are important both for food security and environmental protection .
according to them , seed plays a role in larger relationships such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by brid@@ ging seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is permanently shr@@ inking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material that is becoming more and more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about one third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to either not or only difficult to use .
such estim@@ ations are not yet available for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are still more patented than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ ons
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - such as they improve their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predicted .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ itals and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of crop varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
thus , such protection does not prevent innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the whole , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting the plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , cultiv@@ ates in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just gent@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) possess patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the Pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ enting .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years with a patent , with which in my opinion it is very easy to make . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in open @-@ source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agreement co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa joined forces to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently constructing a global alliance for open @-@ source seed systems for which the official launch should be launched next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non @-@ profit Development Organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report , representing the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ C@@ ID ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about it .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ ding in spite of this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should defend the law , to expose freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all the technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the block@@ age and not to give up . we insist on further fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web page closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada ple@@ aded to the block@@ ade by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to unlock is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i priority ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege condition ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons from the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web page for which I was working .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after having locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

newspapers throughout Brazil are reporting daily newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy banners from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke dispens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 army soldiers , marine and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 Viol@@ ence Unit in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published an editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of crying : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a discourse of war , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who shoot first and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ obli@@ ging public service .
as a reminder , the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of Brazil &apos;s 30 most violent cities are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per State , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was also one of these security policy measures , whose aim is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . for several years , however , U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles published in 2010 explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war is a fact that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police force the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to remain alive : trained Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and during the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside of Damascus , leading to the need for local residents to be locally produced or controlled by tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food @-@ value makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in agreement with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ oo in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to pass 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached about 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the regions originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ating a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to acquire new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co &apos;s paper :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so : there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy as in June , because the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the reform of the forest , introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led to e@@ asing the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open rear door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , they used their own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site numbered more than half a million visitors .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat down in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so , she knew she would no longer see her son - perhaps never more .
at dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party that was dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , were getting closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his small reward and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself to earn his living .
at the time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ pen rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service and no heating there . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we wouldn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ pen was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to those in need twice a day .
it is true that because of relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be dra@@ gged for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it took A@@ shar@@ pen .
but his lifel@@ ong vi@@ le helped A@@ shar@@ an to release himself from these conditions .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ pen put all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( in German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ pen with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my land and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ pen also organis@@ es plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ pen has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
ne@@ tizen report : Egypt draft laws allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody .
he reported on the evi@@ ction of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of their successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website indicating their complete name and identity number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the termination of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the President &apos;s insul@@ t or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian law is already pun@@ ishable by the president as well as state institutions . under the legislative proposal , however , such a crime would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said lawyers of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , captured on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police , while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters that led against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a court death .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups agree , pseudo @-@ pollution of among others , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza denied the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the preceding incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to ev@@ acu@@ ated documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of am@@ nesty .
the document published on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ in &apos;s website sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which sec@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9th May as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that the registration will be required with full real name .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within the social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the spread of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block@@ ade Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the particulars , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
following this week &apos;s fac@@ ett@@ led documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
