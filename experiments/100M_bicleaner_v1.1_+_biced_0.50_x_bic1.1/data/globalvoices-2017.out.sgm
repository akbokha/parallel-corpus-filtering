<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I also grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges, who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "according to Method Man," "" "I think it's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in favour of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican elections was the highest number ever reached by a nominee nominee from the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trump Weltanschauung also agreed with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Slingerie intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who spent her life fighting the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lecco, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dealing with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-electors as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are aware of, have voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note: white against all other ethnic groups); white and whiplash play on white and whiplash, as the big Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one likes to have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumpings, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at rest, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan included the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumpy Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan might find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and a musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa visited.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law burglar of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to refute one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, due to pillage of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier members from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and interact with each other where it is about illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberating existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail's pace with information between individual countries, the actions are happening today in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that were noted or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worth financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million lost in lost revenue which the eight members of the HISH-i network every year lose due to illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world, including those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginary names, fishing-protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamlessly organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "you mustn't run my harbour" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "". "" "" "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close the FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">Illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we are trying to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information with each other. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations indeed influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed through the position of every single trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "to get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and gather their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and hardly expected consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now account for a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we are now also copying other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i.. "with certainty, the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only the ship was on the go without a license and were used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen in Somalia." "" "with taking measures against Greko 1 they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">Her articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is spreading further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "recapturing the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continually deteriorates, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition looked at the inauguration of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, sums up the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine, the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The demonstrators decided to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly following the 2015 elections, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="183">In this way, the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now said to his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that it was OK.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department of 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there, I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine. for so my father had educated me.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photo by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that older people felt insulted by insufficient corrections (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, who are involved in accidents nationwide, is quite an occasion for concern." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speaker should, for example, translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could translate into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost accounting or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious phrases created by machine translation show that this technique can't replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often adorn T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Naveed con Libertad" "" "(Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV was no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels supported recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was clipped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission considered this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology by which the DNS servers answer certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrectly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was broadcast on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPIA cameraman Elvis Flores, who handed over the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections, making it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. as Criminta, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money overrides their underage son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children do not have to pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a treaty that one cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduation, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criminta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against the Criminta generally remains silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who receives the girl and justifies their exploitation with faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon happened in the borrogens in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent strokes. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was the home of the former military unit TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated MarÃ­n as long as she suffered injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they referred the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest meetings and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the Paraguays story a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criminta</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimintas are exploited not only as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to enrol and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of AsunciÃ³n as Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned up the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the master's library than food out of the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal Party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the owner of the house Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read an editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "" "" "the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would be able to" "" "learn bad habits" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">In school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing almost never talked about is mobbing and the harassment that Crimintas are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Society approves Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when it is adopted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to grant social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraph and curses in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video directing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not give any indication of how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a user name and password from the Telecommunications Ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technical University (senior research scientist) at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forcibly controlling physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and that no different narration is present on the scene," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed legislation against cyber crime in which a life sentence for those convicted was found guilty of "threatening public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions. this article is published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which streak through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saicolor). altogether, it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of Leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore stipulates that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">She has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, and still the region is busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was one of the prefecture in Japan's Northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbors Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappeared whole coastal towns off the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">To do this, Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone for this reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after that to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings (for the most part) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned spare-houses were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, it is still hard to relocate the evacuation of temporary shelters into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, still 36000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the 2011 Evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated persons residing in homes after the disaster were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors again until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated. she questioned her about the status of rebuilding and how her empathy has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has intensified their attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">160,000 evacuated Fukushima evacuated almost 63 thousand people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were over 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated people who are still living in Behelfsshelters are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how love for music overcame the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday a police officer had attacked him during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s confessed that Sampaio had been suspended until the investigation of the incident of the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in GoiÃ¢nia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer were beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and all the repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several plumbing shortly afterwards hurry to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is hospitalized.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Soellado calls on further violent attacks against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, only to criminalize the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a punch stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators set up a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), requested the police to forgo violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media falsified street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo deliberately reported about a broken glass window to illustratively design their titles with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken windscreen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title of "protesters on the course of confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Cuba's Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk church Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After that, the sugar cane industry was still standing still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stops every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation again after a long inactive period because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remember exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality looked for better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural perspectives" published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavander." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, got their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closing of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed agree that not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of Pentecost, the first letters began.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was passed on and the letters were more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the downturn of the factory in which he was built.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important worksheet ist was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the then president saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the folk community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to mitigate it, they also stopped to asphalted the road, this also disadvantaged other firms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were replaced with spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production does not even serve the care of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>

<seg id="685">Nene is about 65 years old in retirement, not because it lacks power, but because he is embittered.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this with hip hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cree communities and then with Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will make it possible for the young participants to explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of the Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumeb's First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, in spite of the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters did not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if none of you are interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also advance our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary, the reader and advocate of Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllablement (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("plasma models of dishes") of every dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a variety of these small companies in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, which produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile telephones decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an Empress-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone alive:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing rush into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy stand and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and Lachsammed are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting about drugs bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "render a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "Living with Drug Trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "feats" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by" "" "being rebellious" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was looted with threats." in this she describes how an armed detective month paid money from their business for month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "render a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 initiated the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images for news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became a dangerous path full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck was killed.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theater in the neighbourhood full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and chartered bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned beyond recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." by Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident are the atrocious scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were chopped, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated graphically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria's military and the attempt of the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here again the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misquotations; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a Blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page which 2012 falsely claimed, the president Myanmar's Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article of 2014 about students killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted, the Katholische related news site AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or, for the defence of Muslims, the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who have inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Is this mood of misinformation and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been discussed extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "" "fake news" "". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be solved by the context or in a completely abusive way." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">But each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. confusing) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobregia).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's sales-lap, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Regarding your parents in recognition of how they have strived for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunset language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They determined other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have muscular pains.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there are Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be de-ciliated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now, despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling (TLS) Initiative, counting stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often to it" "", "these events instead" "" "listen to listening in order to appreciate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers will present their history first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also took the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical of their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamamara tells the tale of the hare and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamamara asks:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organizers are hoping to expand this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist from the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, produced excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here royalty free contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the motions for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of periodically extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken part in Adra as a "strictly secret" command of the military court. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bel's cultural prototypes were more propitious than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroad of numerous civilisations, and here the Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Ironically, Bassel could not finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prostitute, which she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique strongly reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants because of the misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic that evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to relinquish his old post, as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the Director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a regression in terms of the efforts of our legal system," "" "said CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have had a disciplinary action against the accrual.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seemed to be silent, however, and did not induce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disproportionate" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious that Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no moral authority:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he insulted it. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks moral returns to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarding.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the familiar social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general used as an adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burmese script" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely dearming connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the use of the word were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (column), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty manner whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before any posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "automatism will not understand what you are writing on facebook." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitters).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spreading hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author wrote his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook" "" "automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control suspicious hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, rather in context than focused on code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were trying to create laws for children's toe followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually uncomplicated situation, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's toe was adopted - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj had announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to now promise his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>

<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally dim.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been the popular encyclopaedia Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using retaining tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the best-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator-machine-connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is accessible, despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we all made it possible to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralised and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also admitted that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vitikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suckling rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28 Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers it the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already face to face to Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home due to the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buzzk appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to make pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyantima and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it avoids women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of an illusionary court from the Indian state of Odisha and violated by her family and community, after having appealed to a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far less rebuke to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, performed a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as child marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected individuals, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands does not say loudly, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to test at home as she is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "". "some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was choked only in front of him; another decided to let the whole frustration of him and his family go out by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about breaking with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the hallmark-red dot on the forehead, which shows the husband:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would wear the" "" "zinnoberred dot" "" "if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things such as our identities attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad-Curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of debate and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini also smuggled their own couple of Curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion of the discussion, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still make it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling about more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29 of this year, the hashtag "bashtag" was to be found in the japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan. in the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch just survived everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll John Lennon should represent or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you must definitely visit.</seg>

<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly this day in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies use the fan community in market terms, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of bald-headed persons for the organ trade, presumably for superstitious purposes, alarmed the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs were used by shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was the local superstition that the head of a bald man could disclose gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC reported.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambra in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police were already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and killing of individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that there exist a faith according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer at the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, podenin Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told me that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as she shared in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to abolish all the limitations of Mr Liu's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak and contact with anyone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for exercising these rights." ""</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where it is needed. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>

<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on June 27 and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed in an explanation on June 28 about Liu very concerned and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore is Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, as Singapore is internationally recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of it, he seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyric emerges from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He addressed the relevant questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he suggests that you should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam which makes such a polemical statement as the leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right associated and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam did" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore come back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet, statements by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why does the people of Singapur perform their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel selection?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain locations are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink brillenframe and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms RamÃ­rez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outdoors on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medication they can't pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answered, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian belief is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachet.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers check their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who left.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves with many photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities refused to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police report, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking porn websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites, to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the East and South, reality is often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("Images from mainland China"), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (...) also published a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." this action, however, violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of speech and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he loops on his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felicyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For the past six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her tried and tested views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities, ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25 Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he has a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation" - he denotes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I'm a man," while he poured NescafÃ© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the drags speak lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From this point on, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" had been canceled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights," "" "who continued to" "" "use" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved to Leibe's traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a well-worn unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honour killings' has increased in Jordan - the official externally left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 Anti-Crime Act, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not shy away from subjects that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been fed up to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," "" "can get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anybody in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib appeals to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they were critical in social media comments critically related to the problems rooted in the country's deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial cracies. at least, he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is concerned, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to the Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trucks, the drums and the dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we had a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gjoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gyoen for a long time: two trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend your summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate job like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy's school, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressers and to receive training in hair arts instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year starting in March, the school provided special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Used with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who are ejecting affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question came from the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the Bogotkind Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Carta por la llliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write guerrillas letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock wore their weapons, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who will then be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC warriors who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia including Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogota Foundation travelled to the camp to personally deliver the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they didn't receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," explains the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I looked into one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut where the guerrillas live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already there was war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people, who have never heard heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters reply to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made aware that peace would rule after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to take arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was busy picking up some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still dishonour the family, you scandy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had provided everything and began screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stab in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which parts of the hospital were you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by walking up the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster that has not only damaged your family, but the entire Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registration, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "don't you think you're in safety just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the # 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I desire, I can't overcome this emotional barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not complete a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposefully submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was involved when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not introduced as bandits, but there have been no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Great ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness of it!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was true, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to approach us originally to" "" "civilians" "", "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had coloured eyelashes, bore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never bent a hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when people laugh at the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just opened their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but above all about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I felt the situation in the Republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I slipped the shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you clear with froth in front of your mouth, that there are no gay men with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestangs have which, the Cabarins have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think about transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there is a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, marked by poverty and unemployment, entered the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hanged themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all fathers of the family who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable uses for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">Unemployment rate among Arab Ahawks rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians coming from Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women, especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists, react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and societal arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling in different areas of life sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still spreading across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence, there is institutionalised form of racist violence that we face black women in two-fold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration backgrounds often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a degrading and marginalized being in historical regard." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to differentiate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to completely remove myself from feminism and join the movement of Womanismus, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call for separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that affects the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector Ada BÃ¡ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman reported Balbuena on account of abuse, the Ada BÃ¡ez 'aclodged advert was of no use.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women generally report an advertisement, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, the women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must first report to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

"there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General claimed 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "in the end of 2014, two women who are unable to do so come to each woman who will be refunded due to physical abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's homicide is not a criminal offender in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately demonstrate how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should be regrettable for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it happened only women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the treatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "(" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case, everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorian ads with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an opaque legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied." ""</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fearing).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# nonnatives) are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law prescribes to explain Feminid to an independent criminal offence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also gain members of the law that advocates the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft law had envisaged the bulk of (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must bear the victims of violence at present, if they simply want to report a complaint and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of punishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we must report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted at the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage that the partners in cases called for domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are taking place.</seg>
<seg id="2541">"" "the" "" "reconciliation" "" "section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victim again." ""</seg>
<seg id="2542">"" "the cancellation of the words" "" "sex" "", "" "" "political violence" "" "and" "" "sexual harassment" "" "from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great setback." ""</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media launched in Oman a year after banning a newspaper continues to attack attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for reporting corruption in the sultante.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, remains in prison where he is serving a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher al-Abri, were also arrested and put on trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, besides his role as the only Sultan, the chief ministers in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, to restrict public freedom, including freedom of the press, and to torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn newspaper, its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman has been reported since its inception in 2007 (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces took Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, after an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties tied to the judiciary." it was about corruption in judicial system and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance controversy.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was charged in front of the Special Affairs Committee and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS was appointed Deputy Editor-in-Chief Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as editor-in-chief for Al-Maamaris arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">"" "the paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that" "" "the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited by any means, including online, as of August 9, 2016." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of public order, abuse of the Internet and "undermining the Presence of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 denominated Rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year ban on professional charges against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to disseminate material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 omanic rival (13,000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">Al-Abri acquitted the appeals court on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remained in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the "Azamn" closure by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information, personally signed another statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and the minister once again appealed the decision of the Appeals Court to repay the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing shutdown of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of Al-Haj, the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Iranian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj to release immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protecting the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman unhinder their legitimate human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliatory measures, including court chicans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is made with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic first showed serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: the main focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I recently started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a mover.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Q: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vis-Ã -vis Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make available to pay (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshaded Gorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents used not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or greyish or cramped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and carrots. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds a salad; however, it needs longer since its work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder that I have to commute." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far to salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing in the United States and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS raised and ate red Roman salat of the Outshaded grape variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT domain and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to them, seed plays a role in larger relationships such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bridging seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is permanently shrinking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material that is becoming more and more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to either not or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimations are not yet available for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that large-scale plants such as wheat are still more patented than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - such as they improve their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predicted.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genitals and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of crop varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not prevent innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "on the whole, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting the plant characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass herbicides, cultivates in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just gentler." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto) possess patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the Patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years with a patent, with which in my opinion it is very easy to make. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open-source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreement col is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa joined forces to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently constructing a global alliance for open-source seed systems for which the official launch should be launched next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international Non-profit Development Organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published a report, representing the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognise him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANCID), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticized this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abiding in spite of this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which should defend the law, to expose freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI confirms that all the technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the blockage and not to give up. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web page closures. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is native, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada pleaded to the blockade by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlock is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege condition; an arrest, attempted murder, summons from the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after having locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Newspapers throughout Brazil are reporting daily newspapers in Brazil with gloomy banners from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "every second day a police officer is killed in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "thieves smoke dispensary with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 army soldiers, marine and air afee to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 Violence Unit in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published an editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new column called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that deviates from civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of crying: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a discourse of war, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who shoot first and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-obliging public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A Peace March in NiterÃ³i in the State of Rio de Janeiro in honor of the murdered Cultural Organizer Rafael.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong: "22 of Brazil's 30 most violent cities are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per State, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003, was also one of these security policy measures, whose aim is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. for several years, however, UPP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repressions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles published in 2010 explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War is a fact that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police force the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and during the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region east of Ghouta is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside of Damascus, leading to the need for local residents to be locally produced or controlled by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food-value makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more" "" "gaining popularity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In agreement with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, you can use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Canoo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to pass 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached about 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel scarcity, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with" "" "production of the regions originating from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas via satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly inflammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, as inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fogos.pt, they used their own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial on this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site numbered more than half a million visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party that was dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, were getting closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small reward and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At the time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharpen recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating there. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we wouldn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharpen was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to those in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that because of relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be dragged for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it took Asharpen.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his lifelong vile helped Asharan to release himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharpen put all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (in German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also have Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Ashara's goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharpen with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharpen also organises plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "so they can sell their harvest surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharpen has made this journey himself. now he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the eviction of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of their successful legislative decision on the authority's website indicating their complete name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the termination of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce tougher penalties for the President's insult or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "Egyptian law is already punishable by the president as well as state institutions. under the legislative proposal, however, such a crime would be punished with prison and fines," "" "said lawyers of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is adopted, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in jeopardy for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), captured on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police, while demonstrating violence against protesters that led against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 Protestants who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in prison for a court death.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to a, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-pollution of among others, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza denied the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the preceding incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to evacuated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was primarily interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April at Nawain's website sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legal situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which secures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9th May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the information offices of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that the registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within the social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively, in order to protect the citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the" "" "organizer of the spread of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogorniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blockade Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia's administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the particulars, Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was blocked because it was" "" "an information source that collaborates with groups to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week's facettled documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until the 19th of May. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>

<seg id="2994">We mourn together with them for the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism as well as all other forms of violence perpetrated against humans due to sexuality, gender identity and expression of their sex. in China violence comes from sexuality, gender identity and expression of sex daily, as for example through bullying of LGBTQ teenagers in schools, generally discriminatory treatment and in the application of therapies with the aim of 'healing' gay and bisexual people.</seg>
