this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA sur@@ rendered to Iran a literally blu@@ epr@@ int for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified ri@@ fts and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en has been living with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , although they have been telling years that it would be essential for their case , the government demands were dropped to ri@@ fts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of sh@@ utting down and making cracks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone cards secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit meeting , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en put@@ ative source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned him more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows to circum@@ vent re@@ porters &apos; rights , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post office .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is up to us to make sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to put away mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and reports of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest environmental representative , the alarm for poll@@ uted water from Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us about the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation this week . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States .
presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in this disclosure , this scandal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data dock of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen proposals for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has captured in central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , che@@ ering on to@@ e tips and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art which he had bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered ?
to host people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is moving and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I was thinking about how to make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public photos of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the type of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one gets into the things that one can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your own mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this low @-@ pit@@ ched panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
for this reason , our company can exist .
so , who actually has Al G@@ ores &apos; mobile phone ?
could you please declare on Twitter that he is running for the President &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that everyone says : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ managed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
we trust most of the people that are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bo@@ ils things together .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you talk too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed parties celebrated or homes destroyed .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , there was only one fraction of the total overnight stays booked by the 123 million overnight stays .
people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , it can be mira@@ culous .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing interact with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when one travels today , it is compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for it .
what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would be waiting for you to thoroughly fill and show one at a quarter mile of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments for a reason to share together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even a host .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was also a lot of hospitality before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives over to me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ st me .
no , not as a homos@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my land being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start a post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we ro@@ de -- as deeply as I traveled in my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ember in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; S@@ ame you not . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday this week -- the day in which Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , distorted and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have pushed the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking lots , but not stopping the terror .
the regular attendance of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and like me , a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people going to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking at her , she does not drive what they read in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring it into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense in their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian regime , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study shows : if you submit messages that have neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they tend to have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you see when the mood for Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
the assignment of collective guilt is not only about explaining itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was talented in dental surgery , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has this young man become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting her in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed home safely ?
we talked about it and it was no easy decision for us , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , put my shoes off , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congreg@@ ations were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with depth , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et delivery came into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . a couple of years ago they started to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , air units reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
they can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the fast development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to beat two birds with a flap .
like other star@@ ry wings , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of hed@@ ge@@ sters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which are at the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts coming together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft flying only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ a , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
there is only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ cut@@ ters , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the h@@ edge algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to make it fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it in the right place is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the moon is an exercise in lust , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the au@@ ti@@ stic ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even rotating like it .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things are available in models , the rest is learned directly by flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ axy , two black holes were cir@@ cling faster and faster , so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars along with all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structures itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events for the first time .
1.3 billion years ago , just a multi @-@ cell life was created on earth .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
this is why we call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the det@@ ective &apos;s start @-@ up , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ro@@ cked through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my ailing father .
in essence , they were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ owed into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often conduct a really al@@ ber@@ ted dance in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretching and st@@ ressing , stretching and st@@ ressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and do@@ cked by us at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the League staff for mad .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all the obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , in fact , impossible to create a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob suspen@@ ds her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same is true for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe talking .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies spin very fast , you hear the same p@@ inch with an additional key change . this sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of motion @-@ vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a whole new way to resear@@ ching the universe , as never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ia stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ ak .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own g@@ lowing .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different view of what happened in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ explained reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from there I started to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things get out of it , stir you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , all nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes simultaneously : 24 episodes : &quot; Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : &quot; how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series runs in 256 countries in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just about to work on the computer , and it is true when I say : I understand that in a dream job it is not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is like I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as if you have a high tone , deliver a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a joy to me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums , then you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the tot@@ ality .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more there are more episodes , the more work there is , the more things watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um@@ my is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby titles .
they were 12 , 3 , and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ led .
I didn &apos;t like my work any more . the engine was out .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase @-@ titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing was I .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ c@@ ite you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you work , you love what you do , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums already once you know the tot@@ als , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become conscious of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my bu@@ zz is smoking , and everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in soli@@ tude and in the lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I complain about programs and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are .
the tot@@ ality is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real tot@@ ality depends on love .
the tot@@ ality is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real tot@@ ality is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ ality ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real tot@@ ality is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it &apos;s law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as good as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at home than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is working better than being at home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden , in front and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the game ?
you can do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speak to my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , it doesn &apos;t need more .
everyone can take 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children will get ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my fe@@ eb@@ le , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll run away and I can win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to be returning when I &apos;m not working .
working is not working without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the tot@@ ality of labour is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s my mind that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the mar@@ sh . the country I created , the mar@@ ath@@ ons , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right amount : the hum@@ ming of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life becomes wider within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I am thinking of things , I will stir you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency department .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in the case of skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain becomes s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any type of cell of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we took a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cell cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are reim@@ planting these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler &apos;s help , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the ape .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we reim@@ plantation the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate it to the human being .
I really hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can get to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy wan@@ es with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh anything if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies will bri@@ gh@@ ten our future and waste our great , new technologies .
on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin top parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too anxious to invest in it , where it would be productive and income , with which you could carry the debt burden and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except infl@@ ate stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand which , like in an endless loop affir@@ ms the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a continuous loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily the circumstances are causing the body to kill him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
his exceedingly wast@@ eful form . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor , as majority , control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same m@@ oods in questions of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bri@@ ghtly , it is burned quickly .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for the ruling class .
for liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing it .
wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power from politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ k with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably has decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that it is star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ises politics itself so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long economy and politics are separate areas , automation leaves the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , just as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
we must therefore transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that he has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that society resembles in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used for human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the matrix @-@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in brief , some examples .
in the company area : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one workplace to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues stem@@ ming from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labor are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who owned the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not owned by the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography itself .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , is the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sense , if I dare to say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now to acc@@ use China of doing what the West has done in the nin@@ eteenth century , sm@@ elling migh@@ ti@@ ly according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to threaten the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back ... Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ or &apos;s side to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s credi@@ tors imposed on us this policy admit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone has not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the liberated centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most have never heard of Roy Price , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ coat and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought field .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment is received .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where after you have looked for a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care to get to the left of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average ou@@ tre@@ ach , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , you get to , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or view again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com across four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optim@@ ise it by using very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV .
does anybody know the company multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way , by data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows visi@@ bly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use a lot of data to make serious decisions , such as deciding for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete so as to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technology demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hind@@ sight to the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
