<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA surrendered to Iran a literally blueprint for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified rifts and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen has been living with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "all of a sudden, although they have been telling years that it would be essential for their case, the government demands were dropped to rifts." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of shutting down and making cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, kept his telephone cards secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit meeting, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen putative source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned him more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">This technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post office.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is up to us to make sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to put away misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and reports of overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest environmental representative, the alarm for polluted water from Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us about the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation this week.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans in this disclosure, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data dock of the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals for our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single leading politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever have changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen proposals for more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have drafted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, cheering on toe tips and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art which he had bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I was thinking about how to make something for it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public photos of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the type of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one gets into the things that one can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your own mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This low-pitched panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So, who actually has Al Gores' mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he is running for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that everyone says: "he can really capture very well-managed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "" "" "because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively." ""</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust most of the people that are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation boils things together.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you talk too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your home! I'm making a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties celebrated or homes destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, there was only one fraction of the total overnight stays booked by the 123 million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">People trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing interact with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is simply not just the" "" "rental industry" "", "but it is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When one travels today, it is compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for it.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would be waiting for you to thoroughly fill and show one at a quarter mile of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments for a reason to share together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a lot of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga is singing, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to oust me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my land being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start a postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- as we rode -- as deeply as I traveled in my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which said, "Be vigilant," "Be vigilant," "Remember in well lit areas," "Same you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking lots, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular attendance of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me, a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalization it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists may make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when looking at her, she does not drive what they read in her" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring it into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense in their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we accept rather an authoritarian regime, conformity and prejudice." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you submit messages that have negatively reported about Muslims, they tend to have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood for Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collective guilt is not only about explaining itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented in dental surgery, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has this young man become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting her in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We talked about it and it was no easy decision for us, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, put my shoes off, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregations were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mentor with depth, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery came into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the audience. a couple of years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, air units reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the fast development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two birds with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starry wings, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedgesters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in what position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts coming together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft flying only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospa, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">There is only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-cutters, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the hedge algorithm of the tailgate. to make it fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it in the right place is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the moon is an exercise in lust, this machine is here, the Omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the autistic ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even rotating like it.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things are available in models, the rest is learned directly by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes were circling faster and faster, so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all the stars along with all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structures itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, just a multi-cell life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why we call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detective's start-up, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rocked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my ailing father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their by observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stowed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers often conduct a really alberted dance in courses for the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretching and stressing, stretching and stressing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and docked by us at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the League staff for mad.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandths of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all the obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, in fact, impossible to create a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now it's just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob suspends her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe talking.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies spin very fast, you hear the same pinch with an additional key change. this sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion-vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving a whole new way to researching the universe, as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseria stars explode in supernovas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is obscured by its own glowing.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different view of what happened in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimations" "" "for unexplained reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimating, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from there I started to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things get out of it, stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, all nine days 20 million dollar television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes simultaneously: 24 episodes: "Grey's, 21 episodes:" how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 countries in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just about to work on the computer, and it is true when I say: I understand that in a dream job it is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you have a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started to work and work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such sums, then you can't strive for greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the totality.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more there are more episodes, the more work there is, the more things watch me, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mummy is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I guess I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3, and 1, when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hypocite you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you work, you love what you do, being a teacher, a banker, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the sums already once you know the totals, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says:" "" "mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become conscious of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "estimation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "estimation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my buzz is smoking, and everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the totals, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I complain about programs and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totality is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real totality depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totality is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real totality is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real totality ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real totality is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as good as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is working better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak to my teenie-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, it doesn't need more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children will get ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeble, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to be returning when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totality of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totality of labour is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's my mind that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who is travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the marsh. the country I created, the marathons, which I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right amount: the humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life becomes wider within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I am thinking of things, I will stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nervous functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the most well known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the case of skull-brain traumas the brain becomes swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any type of cell of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We took a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cell cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-planted them at the reception point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are reimplanting these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the ape.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand side, they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimplantation the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implantiate it to the human being.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can get to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy wanes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish anything if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies will brighten our future and waste our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin top paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest in it, where it would be productive and income, with which you could carry the debt burden and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $5.1 trillion dollar, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except inflate stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand which, like in an endless loop affirms the pessimism of investors, which, as in a continuous loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily the circumstances are causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful form. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor, as majority, control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for the ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, gradually undermining politics and disempowering it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power, because the power from politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shark with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that so sustainably has decimated the animals from which it feeds, that it is starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that cannibalises politics itself so far that it harms itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism sells the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long economy and politics are separate areas, automation leaves the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, just as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must therefore transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that he has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something that society resembles in "Star Trek," in which machines are used for human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the matrix-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you, in brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company area: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one workplace to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues stemming from capital and from redeeming, and the concept of wage labor are completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who owned the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not owned by the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography itself.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"" "" "" "as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, is the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I dare to say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now to accuse China of doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smelling mightily according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "that is to say goodbye to the complacency, and the constant denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone and continues to threaten the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denounce denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it will happen abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back... Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the donor's side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "" "" "none of the troika's creditors imposed on us this policy admit:" "" "it was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone has not survived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the liberated centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for visiting TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most have never heard of Roy Price, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelcoat and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought field.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addictive to where after you have looked for a relay, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care to get to the left of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to underline "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average outreach, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, you get to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or view again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom across four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimise it by using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the awful way, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows visibly into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very clever people use a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as deciding for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete so as to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then when they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
